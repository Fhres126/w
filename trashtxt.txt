▶'oa doea od'{

oa o!1p=this A.

'1p' mean 1th parameter. type of this word is type of parameter.

doea !t=time.

't' mean 'time' so type of this word is time.

od !t=now.//c this, time,

'c' is an abbreviation for 'compound word'.

'c A, B' mean 'this word consist of word A and word B'.

if there are '//c' then the word is compound word or abbreviation.

'od' is abbreviation for 'oa doea'. 'oa doea' mean 'this time'.

in this case, 'c' used to mean 'abbreviation'.

4bit is from 'oa'(0111,0000).

af o,o!1p=A of B.//c A that is B, element,

this function need two parameter. and parameter type is object and object.

B is second input object of this function.

third is C. fourth is D...

eg 'af A B' mean 'A of B'.

reason why 'af' is 'c A that is B, element' is that 'ab A hc B' mean 'A that is (element of B)'.

ab o,o!1p=A that is B.

hc o!1p=element of A.

'c A that is B, element,' seems 'ah' since first letter of 'ab' and 'hc' is 'a' and 'h'.

only number word must be in between 'ag' and 'ph'.(eg 'ag', 'bg', 'cg'....'ph')

'ah' is in it so 'ah'(00001110) become 'af'(00001010).

▶how to use word 'ea' basic{

In this language, the word for 'what'(as in 'what I love') is 'ea'.

if i love you, then you are what i love. we can know word for 'what' return direct object.

'mkfd bd oe' mean 'i love you'.

'ea mkfd oe bd' mean you are what i love. 'ea mkfd oe' mean 'what i love'.

happily, word 'ea' can express more thing.

let's see definition of word 'mkfd'.

mkfd o,n!r=thing that love A.//e B is degree of love,

yes, second parameter is degree of love so if we make word 'ea' return second parameter, then we can express degree of love(how much do i love you).

'ea nh' return second parameter cuz 'nh' mean 2.

'ea nh mkfd bd oe' mean 'how much do i love you'.

'he mkfd bd oe' mean same cuz word 'he' is 'ea nh'. this word is for efficient.

'ea mkfd bd pa oe' mean same. word 'pa' is in place for expressing degree of love.

▶'oidd kjgg ad bd'{

oidd o,o,n!r=thing that need to be A to be B.//c need,AB,self,

reason why word 'oidd' is abbreviation fot 'oilb' and 'ab' and 'dd'?

ab o,o!1p=A that is B.

dd !r=self.

'oilb ab dd A B' mean 'thing that need (oneself that is A) for being B'.

This expreasion is a bit awkward so i will explain with an example.

sentence 'oilb ab dd A B C' mean 'C need C that is A to be B'. 

The floor of 16 divided by 3 is 5 but this compound word is not made by 5bits cuz the length of element word in the compound word must be a power of 2.

so 'oidd' is 4bit + 4bit + 8bit.

it is 0111 + 0000 + 11001100.

8th bit become 1.

8bit + 4bit + 4bit is prohibited cuz the earlier-used word should be made with fewer bits but if quantity of bit of element word is 8 or more, then all bit dont need to be reduced.

as i mentioned, 'c' can mean abbreviation.

'i dislike being human' can be translated into 'dnfd ab dd anga oe'.

'...' in right of str is the quantity of parameter is determnined by number that is around.

eg 'eg lh ba' is text 'ba'.

eg 'eg nh baba' is text 'baba'.

'mkfd bd ih' mean 'thing that love you with zero percent power'.

this expression might be awkward.

'thing that love you with zero percent power' mean 'thing that dont love you'.

ih !n=zero.

in this sentence, 'oe' automatically omit second parameter 'n' of 'mkfd' cuz number type didnt be inputed in the number parameter.

i will explain reason why 'love' is 'c hope, profit'.

Love has various meanings.

There is the love between parents and children, and romantic love.

This word refers to the love between a parent and a child.

fd n!r=thing that gains profit.

'mc fd A' mean 'thing that hope that A is thing that gains profit'.

meaning of braille depending on the language.

shape of letter 'a' in english braille is shape of 'b' in Chinese Braille.(chinese braille use latin alphabet so This will cause a lot of inconvenience.

▶nletter{

if specific word is not exist in norlang, then explain pronunciation using nletter temporary like 'AINC.YTAIN'(einstein) but word that is made ny nletter cant be function.

nletter must be capital letter if it is used in norlang.

symbol '.' make pronunciation stronger. eg .a is [ja]. .k is [k͈]

this alphabet have only 24letter(english have 26letter) but it express many pronunciation than other system.

▶initial consonant{

'ae anga mkfd oe' = 'ab anga ea mkfd oe'{

free translation: 'people that i love', 'lovely people'.

FYR: (ae anga mkfd oe), (ab anga (ea mkfd oe)).

literal translation: 'people that is what i love'.

ae <c n>,o,s!v=A that C2 C1.//C2 is subject,,C1 is verb,,c A that is B,what,

ab o-o!p=A that is B.

'ae anga mkfd oe' mean 'ab anga ea mkfd oe'.

'ab anga ea mkfd oe' mean 'people that are what i love'.

'ae' is for efficient.

}

'

We will learn some words that work like abbreviations.

'he' is 'ea nh' so 'he mkfd bd oe' is 'ea mh mkfd bd oe'.

and it mean 'how much I love you'.

'ne' is 'ae mh' so 'ne anga ed mkfd oe' is 'ae mh anga ed mkfd oe'.

and it means 'people that i loved'.

'bd ea mkfd oe' = 'mkfd bd oe'{

free translation: 'what i love is you', 'i love you'.

FYR: bd (ea mkfd oe), (mkfd bd) oe.

literal translation: 'you are what i love', 'i am thing that love you'.

'ea' is similar to 'what' of english so 'ea' have sentence type parameter but some function in sentence of 'ea' dont have some parameter.

'ea' mean n-th parameter.

'ea mkfd oe' mean first parameter of 'mkfd'.

if i love you, 'ea mkfd oe' mean you.

so To know the meaning, you need to list the parameters of all function in parameter sentence of the 'ea'.

mkfd is in sentence of 'ea'.

mkfd o,n!r=thing that love A with B percent power.

first parameter is 'o' of 'mkfd'.(what it loves)

second parameter is 'n' of 'mkfd'.(how much it loves)

if word 'ea' target second parameter like it mean 'how much it loves'.

}

word 'ea' is expressed in word dictionary but it cant be expressed using symbols of word dictionary so it is for only reference.

ea c n,s!v=what.//this word remove Ath parameter.

'ea nh mkfd bd oe'{

nh !n=two.

'nh' is in parameter 'c n' of 'ea' so 'ea mh' mean second parameter.

To know the meaning, you need to list the parameters of all function in parameter sentence of the 'ea'.

mkfd o,n!r=thing that love A with B percent power.

first parameter is 'o' of 'mkfd'.(what it loves)

second parameter is 'n' of 'mkfd'.(how much it loves)

so 'n' of 'mkfd' is deleted, and 'ea nh mkfd bd oe' mean 'how much i love you'.

}

'bd ea mkfd pa oe' = 'mkfd bd oe'{

free translation: ''you are what i love', 'i love you'.

FYR: 'bd (ea mkfd pa oe)', '(mkfd bd) oe'.

literal translation: 'you are what i know', 'i am thing that know you'.

The 'pa' is in parameter that i wanna express.

parameter of 'lb' is 'what it know'.

}

'ea mkfd bd' = 'ea lh mkfd bd' = 'ea mkfd pa bd'{

there three mean same.

}

'ined !r=folder.//c group,code,,g AB,group,for being,include,code,'{

'g' is abbreviation for 'grammar'.

'g A, B' mean definition of this word is 'A B' in norlang grammar.

the capital letter 'AB' in 'g AB, group...' is norlang word.

it is used for words that cannot be translated into English or when the definition of a word is too long.

ab o-o!r=A that is B.

'g AB,group,include,code,' mean 'group for being thing that include code' in literal translation.

but this word is 'c group,code' since it is important word.

word maker should make order is ramained.

someome can think this word can be expressed as 'g AB,include,code,group,' instead of 'g AB,group,include,code,'

if word order is not important, function should be in after.

}

'ab o-o!1p=A that is B'{

'A-B' means that if the A is omitted by symbol that omit parameter then the B is automatically omitted.

originally 'ad' can omit one parameter but 'o-o' can be omitted by only one 'ad'.

If one parameter of this word is omitted, why this word is used?

it is not needed.

if parameter of this word is 'o,o', then 'ab ad A' mean just 'A'.

this is for efficient so you can use few symbol that omit parameter.

}

'ge <o-o>-n!2p=thing that use A to become B.'{

inside '<' and '>' is one group.

so in <A-B>-C, if <A-B> is omitted by symbol that omit parameter then C is automatically omitted.

<A-B>-C can be omitted by only one symbol that omit parameter.

word 'ge' whose first parameter is omitted is dont needed cuz word that mean 'become' is exist.

}

IIIIISVVVFFFPPPW

'I' mean 'initial consonant'.

'S' make vowel stronger.

'V' mean 'vowel'.

'F' mean 'final consonant'.

'P' mean 'punctuation' like '?', '!', '~'.

second 'W' mean whether to dont make.(0 finish).

eg adpa(00001.1.001.111.0000) is /s͈ja/

chart for 'I'{

00001 is [s͈].

10001 is slient vowel.
01001 is h.

}chart for 'I'

chart for 'F'{

 is none consonant.

}chart for 'F'

chart for 'P'{

100 is '~'.

010 is '!'.

110 mean none.

001 is '?'.

free translation: 'i see you using my eye'.

literal translation: i am thing that use eye of me to be thing that see you.

'anmd o!p=her A.//c of,she,.'{

fjmd !r=she.//c the A,women,.

compound word of 'of' and 'she' seems 'anea'.

but word 'anea' already exsit so element of compound word is splited to be smaller.

word 'af' wont be smaller cuz it is already 8bit.

af o-o!2p=A of B.//c A that is B,element,.

take initial of 'fjda', 'mlmb'.

it is 'e', 'm'.

combined is 'em'(00100011).

and Set the 8th bit to 0.

so result is 'ee'.

'an'+'ee'='anee'.

if A know B and C.
