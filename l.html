This artificial language is called veluil(Versatile Efficient Logical Unambiguous International Language) in English.

▶advantage of this language{

this language is most versatile and most efficient and most logical unambiguous eco-friendly language.

This language has many advantages, so I will explain them in three parts: versatility, logic, and efficiency.

▶examples of the versatile{

this language version of barcodes is exist and it is called NLQR1. NLQR1 is most efficient 1D code. it is usually four times more efficient than barcode. barcode use 145cell to mention 'i am person' but NLQR1 use 28cell.
</pre>
  <img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/vsbar.jpg" alt="connect error">
  <pre>
this language version of QR code is exist and it is called NLQR2. NLQR2 is most efficient 2D code. NLQR2 is usually over 4 times more efficient than a QR code. eg QR code use 441cell to mention 'i am person' but NLQR2 use 32cell.
  </pre>
  <img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/vsqr.jpg" alt="connect error">
  <pre>
NLQR mean NLQR1, NLQR2, NLQR3. all NLQR have finder pattern so it can be accurately decoded from any orientation.
  </pre>
  <img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/principlenlqr.jpg" alt="connect error">
  <pre>
NLQR3 is most efficient code.
  </pre>
  <img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/nlqrs.jpg" alt="connect error">
  <pre>
NLQR can help cheating in exam because it is human-readble. it takes up little space and most people won't think of it as a language, so it won't get caught.

imagine what if NLQR replace pictogram. we dont need to learn lot of pictogram.
  </pre>
  <img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/hatepictogram.jpg" alt="connect error">
  <pre>
this language version of morse code is exist and it is called NL morse. NL Morse is usually two times more efficient than Morse code. morse code cant explain mathmatical expression but NL morse can express all meaning.

this language version of braille is exist and it is called NL braille. NL braille is usually 1.5 times more efficient than braille. original Braille is ambiguous cuz meaning of original braille depending on direction but NL braille can have same meaning in any direction.

Sign language is difficult or inefficient for expressing new words or slang but this language's sign language is not.

this language is a binary language so it can easily be converted into NLQR and NL morse and NL braille and sign language and minecraft language and etc. you can learn it easily so you can do many things by learning this language so person who learn this language can easily communicate with the blind and the deaf.

this language is efficient. efficient is necessary to be versatile.

keyboard that is for this language is easy to type cuz it has only 2~16letter.
  </pre>
  <img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/easykeyboard.jpg" alt="connect error">
  <pre>
this language can be unambiguous interpreted without whitespace so it deosnt need hassle mark eg whitespace and hyphen.

}◀example of the versatile

▶example of the easy{

this language use phonetic script but this language is pronounced differently from english and it is easy to pronounce and unambiguous. this language can express all pronunciation using parameter.

most words are not randomly made.

lot of words is compound words.(eg word 'hnmc' mean music. word 'hnmc' is compound word of sound and fun. word 'bomc' mean sports. it is compound word of compete and fun)

lot of words is abbreviations.(eg word 'od' mean now. word 'od' is abbreviation for 'Oa Doea'(this time))

lot of words are arranged in an orderly way.(eg bihd mean hydrogen(Atomic number 1). cihd mean helium(Atomic number 2). dihd mean lithium(Atomic number 3). eihd mean beryllium(Atomic number 4))

so it help technology grow cuz it make science easy.

Words used in similar situations or words with similar meanings are made of similar letters. eg mkfd mean love. mkid mean like. mkcd mean pleasure so you can easily guess the meaning of abbreviation you see for the first time.

lot of antonym is made by word formation rule for antonym.

this language have very few suffix.(maybe 4)

part of speech of this language is only noun and function.

if you learn a little grammar, then you can explain every meaning, regardless of your native language. grammar is simplest and consistent by using  prefix notation so this language can be used in programming without change of grammar. the programming language is called 'pmfa'. other programming languages have limits. For example, C++ cannot represent numbers beyond a certain size, but pmfa can represent all number.

Word stress is not required for word distinction in this language.

}◀example of the easy

▶example of the logical{

english easly becomes ambiguous. eg 'i love situation that i love person who love cow and people and chicken or he eat meal'. but this language express all situation without ambiguous.

word think have three meaning it is imagine and beilive and ponder so word for think is not exist in this language.

this language dont have slang.

this language doesn't have exceptions.

this language dont have homonyms and synonyms.

unambigous is very good for language cuz it make efficient cuz it doesn't need any additional explanation or images to explain exactly.

}◀example of the logical

▶example of the efficient{

'i know you' is 80bit in ascii code. 'i know you' in this language is 'lbbd' it is 16bit. this language can express all using only binary. and one letter is just for only expressing 4bit so it is 16bit.

}◀example of the efficient
  
▶why this language must be IAL{
    
if all human use this language environmental pollution will be reduced.

The prevention of environmental pollution through this language is enormous scale.

most data in world is video data but if someone speak in this language, the someone dont need to speak for long time so video become short.

A sentence that takes 10 seconds to say in English can be said in just 5 seconds in this language.

this language is very consistent so polution by AI and LLM will be reduced.
    
An ambiguous IAL creates misunderstandings and promotes conflict.
    
it make easy communication between disabled people and non-disabled.

unlogical IAL make mankind uncivilized.
    
}◀why this language must be IAL

}◀advantage of this language

Among the people I’ve seen, those who dislike this language didn’t even properly read this document.

▶refute to concerns{

concerns: lot of words are arranged in an orderly way? so 'foea' mean minute. 'goea' mean hour but the pronunciation is similar so it is hard to distinguish in noisy place.

refute: I recorded 'foea', 'goea', and 'hoea'. Then, I played the video in a noisy place to see whether I could recognize them exaxtly. They were very easy to distinguish. It won't be a problem if you well pronounce them.

concerns: i hate this wrting system. it cant explain interjection and foreign word.

refute: no, this writing system can express interjection and foreign word using specific parameter type. if we change alphabet then we cant use world most efficient system(NLQR, NLmorse). this alphabet make we can easily pronunce all that can be expressed as binary so we can pronunce 🕎 without learning name.

other refute to concerns is appear when explain new thing. Even if I refute it now, you won’t know what I’m talking about.

▶why this language is made{

Language is extremely important because it makes humans superior. A language must not be inferior, and it must not hinder science, scholarship, or other fields. i made this language using this thought.

}◀why this language is made

▶alphabet{

* this language use only 0 and 1. it can be expressed as 16 latin letter.

a = 0000. b = 1000. c = 0100. d = 1100.

e = 0010. f = 1010. g = 0110. h = 1110.

i = 0001. j = 1001. k = 0101. l = 1101.

m = 0011. n = 1011. o = 0111. p = 1111.

this language uses only lowercase letters.

more efficient alphabet is here:
</pre>
<img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/efficientalphabet.jpg" alt="connect error">
<pre>
 it in unicode:
. | : ᴦ 
⠍ ⎛ ꜒ >
ㅏ ㅇ 7 ᓱ
P = ⵎ 0

braille is 2×3 and this alphabet is 2×3 so this alphabet can be used as braille. but other braille for this language is exist for efficient.

}◀alphabet

▶word separation, spacing{

purpose of this section: making you can distinguish border of words.

* one word consist of 8n bits.

* 8n-th bit that is zero is end of word.

it play role of whitespace of english so this language dont need whitespace.

eg '11111110' is one word.

* 8n-th bit 1 make the word consist of more bit.

'11111111 11111110' is one word.

this language dont need whitespace but i will use whitespace to make you easily understand.

quiz: How many words does this sentense have?

'mkfdbdoe'.

(1) 1.
(2) 2.
(3) 3.

answer: 3.

}◀word separation, spacing

▶pronunciation{

purpose of this section: making you know how to pronunce binary.

* Two letters make one syllable.

* (2n-1)th letter is pronounced as initial consonant. 

* 2n-th letter is pronounced as vowel and final consonant.

eg 'bb anba' is pronounced as [ bo membu ].

if 'b' is in (2n-1)-th letter then it pronounced as 'b'.

if 'b' is in 2n-th letter then it is pronounced as 'o'.

in pronunciation chart, 'b' is expressed as follwing.

b = /b/, /o/,

then 'anba' is pronounced as 'membu' then it can be simplified as 'meb'.

this language can express all pronunciation using specific parameter.

▶pronunciation chart{

the pronunciation is arranged with lower Hz sounds coming first. so it is not biased toward any specific culture.

▶IPA version{

a = /m/, /u/. b = /b/, /o/, . c = /d/, /ʌ/. d = /g/, /ɯ/.

e = /n/, /a/. f = /ɾ/, /ɛ/. g = /p͈/, /i/. h = /t͈/, /wʌ/.

i = /k͈/, /um/. j = /p/, /om/. k = /t/, /ʌm/. l = /k/, /ɯm/.

m = /tɕ/, /am/. n = /t͈ɕ/, /ɛm/. o = /t͡ʃ/, /im/. p: /s/, /wɛ/.

}◀IPA version

}◀pronunciation chart

▶read it if you dislike this pronunciation{

initial consonant that is easy to distinguish is 19.

vowel that is easy to distinguish is 10.

silent final consonant and h aren't used cuz it make problem.

The pronunciation [ma] is made by quickly saying [m] and [a].

The pronunciation [ta] is made by quickly saying [d] and [ha].

sometime we can interpret 'ta' as 'd ha' if we talk slowly.

if word is long then there are final consonant 'm'.

This mechanism makes long word difficult to say so user dont wanna made long word so it becomes efficient.

pronuncing binary make we can pronunce all without learning name.

}◀read it if you dislike this pronunciation

}◀pronunciation

you can learn using quickly learn section or slowly learn section.











▶slowly learn(not finished but can helpful){

all part of speech of this language is noun and function and nitog. nitog mean word that dont impact to grammar.

word 'anga' mean 'human'. and in word dictionary, it is expressed as follwing.

anga !r=human.

this is called word dictionary formular. word dictionary formular is for efficiently explaining words. the 'r' is in place for explaining word type. the 'r' mean 'realty' so this word type is 'reality'. only thing that can be in reality must be reality type word.

word 'nb' mean 'i' and 'me'. it is abbreviation for 'Na Blca'(this who assert). and in word dictionary, it is expressed as following.

nb !r=i.//c this, assert,

additional explanation is in right of the dot. you should see additional explaination to easily remember word.

in this lecture, i wont use word that i didnt teach.

sentence 'anga nb' mean 'i am human'. the word 'anga' is in left hand side. the word 'nb' is in right hand side. if you didnt speak right hand side then right hand side automatically be 'i'. so just speaking 'anga' is enough to mean 'i am human'. we use word 'i' lot so this mechanism increace efficiency of language. if you didnt write right hand side then right hand side automatically be 'this' so building that is labeled 'restaurant' means that 'this is a restaurant'.

we will learn function word here. you should know object mean noun or function. word 'fc' is function that must have two object type parameter. word 'fc' is abbreviation for 'fa kf'. 'fa kf' is 'thing that command to answer'. and in word dictionary, it is expressed as following.

fc o,o!r=thing that ask B about A.//c command,answer,//e omitted B is you.

the 'o' is in place for explaining parameter that function must have. the 'o' is abbreviation for 'object' so object can be inputed in this function as parameter.

the capital letter in between equal sign and dot must be changed into input value. A must be changed into first input value. B must be changed into second input value. C must be changed into third input value... 'fc anga nb' mean 'thing that ask me about human'. '//e' is used to explain word using sentence.

all sentence of this language consist of left hand side and right hand side. 

in sentence 'fc anga nb nb', parameter of 'fc' is full so this function cant have manier parameter so place for left hand side is done. you must remember this mechanism to recognize what is left hand side and right hand side.

we will learn how to say 'what is your name?' so we need to learn word for of and word for name and word for you.

word 'af' mean 'of'. this word must have two object as parameter. type of word 'af' is type of first input parameter. this word is expressed as following in word dictionary.

af o,o!1p=A of B.//c A that is B, element of A,//r pencil that is element of me is pencil of me.

the '1p' mean type of this word is type of first input parameter.

additional explanation '//r' is used to explaining why this word is made in this way.

word 'blga' mean name. meaning of name similar to meaning of code so form of word for name similar to word for code. '//s code,' that is in additional explanation mean form of this word similar to word for code. word for name is expressed as following in word dictionary.

blga !r=name.//s code,

word for you is antonym of me. this word is made by word formation rule for antonym. form of antonym is inversed bit from original word. for example, antonym of me('nb'(10111000)) is you('cg'(01000110)). 8n-th bit must not be changed by being word separation code. and the word is expressed as following in word dictionary.

cg !r=you.//a me,

this word can be expressed as diffrent way. capital letter that is in additional explanation is this language word so this word dictionary formular can be expressed as following.

cg !r=you.//a NB,

sentnece 'fc af blga cg' mean 'i am thing that ask you about name of you'.

you can use word 'kf' to answer.

kf o,o!r=thing that answer A to B.//a ask,//e omitted B is you.

sentence 'kf bicc' is sentence 'i am thing that answer bicc to you'.

sentence 'gillpa af blga nb' mean 'my name is gillpa' but you can omit second parameter of word 'af'.

we will learn how to say hello.

olga o!r=thing that greet A.//s call,

od o!r=thing that call A.

form of this word is similar in binary. this language dont need word 'hello' and 'hey'. sentence 'olga' mean 'hello' and 'i am thing that greet'. sentence 'od' mean 'hey' and 'i am thing that call'.

bjjh o!r=thing that bye A.//a greet,

you can use this word to bye.

we will learn how to say 'do you have water?' so we will learn word for whether and word for have and word for water. word 'ja' must have sentence as parameter. this word is expressed as following in word dictionary.

ja s!r=whether A2 is A1.

sentence type parameter is just 'o,o'. A1 is first element of first parameter of this function so A1 is first 'o'. A2 is second 'o'.

ke o!r=thing that have A.//a element,

goda !r=water.//s liquid,

sentence 'fc ja ke goda cg' mean 'i am thing that ask you about whether you are thing that have water'.

we wiĺl learn how to say 'give me water'.

fa s!r=thing that command A2 to be A1.//e omitted A2 is you.

gb s,n!r=thing that cause A2 be A1.//e B is degree of cause.

sentence 'fa gb ke goda nb' mean 'i am thing that command you to be thing that cause i be thing that have water'.

we will learn how to say 'thank you'.

mood o,n!r=thing that thank A.//e B is degree of thank.

sentence 'mood cg' mean 'thank you'.

word 'mjib' must have object and number as parameter. the number is for explainng degree of love.

mjib o,n!r=thing that like A.//s love,//e B is degree of love.

in sentence 'mjib anga nb', second parameter of word 'mjib' automatically be omitted by other type word. this sentence mean 'i am thing that like you'.

word 'ea' is 'what' as in 'what you like'. word 'ea' reurn n-th parameter. word 'lh' is one so 'ea lh' return first parameter.

in sentence 'mjib anga cg', the word 'anga' is in first parameter of the sentence so 'ea lh mjib cg' return 'anga'. word 'ea' that dont have number type parameter automatically return first parameter.

sentence 'fc ea mjib cg' mean 'i am thing that ask you about what you like' and 'what do you like?'.

we will learn how to say 'i am from united states of america'.

ondb o!r=thing that come from A.//c move,DB,

word 'eienpd' mean 'united states of america'. pronunciation of this word is derived from 'USA' of english. additional explanation '//p A, B,' mean pronunciation of this word similar to A in language B. ISO 639-1 code is in the B. this word is expressed as following in word dictionary.

eienpd !r=united states of america.//p USA, en,

in sentence 'ondb eienpd nb' mean 'i am from united states of america'.

we learn this language so lets learn how to say 'i learn veluil'.

mmlb o!r=thing that learn A.//c becoming,know,

pmag !r=veluil.

so sentence 'mmlb pmag nb' mean 'i learn veluil'.

we will learn how to say 'can you speak veluil?'.

lg o,n!p=thing that can be A with B percent probability.

hnda o,o!r=thing that speak A to B.//c sound,mention,

sentence 'fc ja lg hnda pmag' mean 'can you speak veluil?'.

ff !r=true.

sentence 'kf ff' mean 'i am thing that answer you to true' and 'yes'.

we will learn how to say number.

word 'kg' is for explainng decimal number.

kg dec!n=.//e this word is for explainng decimal number.

binary that is in dec type parameter is not word. 'b' that is in dec type parameter is 1. 'a' that is in dec type parameter finish dec type parameter.

'kg ba' mean 'one'.

c is 2. d is 3. e is 4. f is 5. g is 6. h is 7. i is 8. j is 9. k is 0.

this language use little andian so 'kg bcdefgka' mean '654321'.

we can say some number shortly.

ih !n=zero.

lh !n=one.

nh !n=two.

ph !n=three.

jh !n=four.

kh !n=minus one.

mh !n=minus two.

oh !n=minus three.

we will learn how to say 'meet at 9a.m!'.

word 'goea' mean hour. type of this word is time. this word is next word of word for minute. next word is one bit higher than original word. 

goea n!t=A hour.//n minute,

foea n!t=A minute.//n second,

mc t,o!2p=thing that is B when A.

nnad o!r=thing that met A.//a around,

sentence 'fa mc goea kg ja nnad' mean 'meet at 9a.m!'.

we will learn how to say 'at that time, i see you'.

word 'pf' can be inputed in every parameter by being object type word.

pf !o=it.

if word 'pf' is inputed in time type parameter then this word must be time so word 'pf' that is in time type parameter is translated as 'that time'.

lica o!r=thing that see A.//c sense,photon,

sentence 'mb pf lica cg nb' mean 'i am thing that see you at that time'.

we will learn tense.

ed o!1p=thing that was A.

sentence 'ed mjib cg nb' mean 'i was thing that like you'.

suffix ep- mean was.

sentence 'epmjib cg nb' mean 'i was thing that like you'.

but this suffix can be used for only function.

le o!1p=thing that will be A.//a was,

sentence 'le mjib cg nb' mean 'i will be thing that like you'.

suffix lp- mean will.

sentence 'lpmjib cg nb' mean 'i will be thing that like you'.

we will learn singular.

if first parameter of word 'ie' is omitted then the first parameter is one.

ie n,o!1p=A B.//e omitted A is one.

'ie anga' mean 'a human'.

we will learn plural.

suffix gp- make plural.

'gpanga' mean humans.

you can say 'i see human' even if you see lot of human.

we will learn pronoun.

na o!1p=this A.

oa o!1p=that A.

pa o!1p=the A.

pimd !r=she.//c the,women,

pide !r=he.//c the,men,

word for we can mean 'me and you' and 'friend of me'.

boba !r=we.//e me and you.

mjnb !r=we.//c friend,me,//e friend of me.

we will learn how to say oneself and themselves and yourself and myself etc.

db n!r=Ath right hand side.

'db lh' return first right hand side.

sentence 'mjib db lh nb' mean 'i love myself'.

'i love myself' mean 'i love me'.

word that mean me is in first right hand side so 'db lh' can be work as oneself and themselves and yourself and myself etc.

dd !r=self.//c DB,LH,

we will learn all word that omit parameter.

ad !si=word that omit one parameter.

bc !si=word that omit two parameter.

cc !si=word that omit three parameter.

dc !si=word that omit four parameter.

we will learn word for and.

word 'be' have object type parameter until this word met symbol that omit parameter.

be c o!1p=A1 and A2 and A3 and...

'be cg pf ad' mean 'you and it'.

if there function word then you should use more word that omit parameter.

in 'be cg lb ad ad' first 'ad' omit parameter of word 'lb'. second 'ad' finish parameter of word 'be'. you can say it as 'be cg lb bc'.










we will learn word 'hb'.

For the sentence “A is animal” to be true, what A must be?

if A is pig then it is true but animal is pig is false but 'wheel is part of car' and 'part of car is wheel' is true cuz 'part of car' is defined by word 'hb'.

hb c o!1p=.

in this document, object mean noun or function.

explaing logical language using unlogical language is difficult so sometime i will use this language to explain this language so you should well understand.

you need to learn how to interpret word dictionary to learn words. here is basic.

▶basics of interpreting a word dictionary{

purpose of this section: making you know basic how to interpret word dictionary.

explanation in word dictionary consist of following.

[this language word] [parameter that this word must have]![word type]=[meaning].//[addiotional explanation]

oojb !r=alive thing.

word is expressed as it in word dictionary.

* far left is this language word.

* between '!' and '=' is word type.

* right of '=' is meaning of this word.

* 'r' is an abbreviation for 'reality'. it is type of only word that is not number or etc.

jd o!r=thing that imagine A.

between this language word and '!' is parameter type that this function must have. if it is exist then this word should have parameter.

'o' is an abbreviation for 'object' so all object can be inputed in this function.

there are capital letter in right of '='. A is first inputed value. B is second inputed value. C is third inputed value... change the capital letter to inputed value of function.

for example, 'jd bd' mean 'thing that imagine you' cuz 'bd' mean 'you'.

of o,o!r=thing that go from B to A.

B is second inputed parameter. third is C.

'of ajoa fodg' mean 'thing that go from house to here' cuz 'ajoa' mean 'here'. 'fodg' mean 'house'.

Q: this word should have parameter so how to say 'i dont know word imagine' in this language?

A: it is 'eb lb elfa jd', word in parameter of 'elfa' deosnt have parameter.

▶type dictionary{

'o' is abbreviation for object. word whose this is parameter can have every type parameter. word whose this is word type can be inputed in every type parameter.

'si' type word dont impact to grammar defautly. for example, line break is si type.

'n' is abbreviation for number.

't' is abbreviation for time.

's' is abbreviation for sentence. it is just o,o. for example,

cf s!r=situation that A2 is A1.

'A1' mean first 'o'. 'A2' is second 'o'.

parameter type 'what' is like 'what' as in ' what i know'.

ea what!r=.

word 'ea' return n-th parameter.

lh !n=one.

jd o!r=thing that imagine A.

'ea lh' return first parameter in sentence. 'ea lh jd oe' return first parameter of word 'jd' so it mean what i imagine. if there are no number then it automatically return first parameter. word 'pa' can be used. 'ea jd pa oe' mean 'what i imagine'.

'int' is binary string that consist of integer multiple of 8 bits. for example,

elfa int!r=word A.

object that is inputed in this function dont have parameter.

'dec' is for saying decimal number. 4bits in parameter is one decimal number.

for example,

fg dec!=.

'a' finish parameter dec. 'b' is 1. 'c' is 2. 'd' is 3. 'e' is 4. 'f' is 5. 'g' is 6. 'h' is 7. 'i' is 8. 'j' is 9. 'k' is 0 since if 'a' is '0' it cant be visible in NLQR. this language use little andian so 'fg bc ka' is 21.

}◀type dictionary

▶addiotional explanation dictionary{

kjgg !r=dead thing.//a alive,

'//' is for an additional explanation.

'a' is an abbreviation for 'antonym'.

* 'a A' mean 'this word is antonym of A'.

* The antonym form is the inversion of the original word's bits. 0 becomes 1. 1 becomes 0.

for example, antonym of 
'fojb'(10100111,10011000) is 
'kjgg'(01011001,01100110).

'//a alive,' is same as '//a FOJB,'.

8n-th bit dont be changed since it is for explaining length of word.

'n A' mean this word is next word of A.  for example,

hoea n!t=A hour.//n minute,

goea n!t=A minute.//n second,

the letter is increaced. g into h.

'c A, B,' mean this word consist of A and B. if there are it then this word is compound word or abbreviation. for example,

od !t=now.//c this, time,

this word is abbreviation for 'Oa Deoa'(this time).

'd A' mean this word is made in time A. 

'e A' mean explanation of this word is A.

'u A' mean form of this word is changed in time A.

'p A B' mean pronunciation of this word similar to A in language B.

's A B' mean form of this word similar to word A in language B. if there are no B then the word is derived from this language.

▶other code{

be c o!1p=A1 and A2 and...

parameter 'c A' mean this word have parameter until this word met symbol that omit parameter.

'be A A A ad' mean 'A and A and A'.

▶suffix{

suffix 'gp-' make word into plural. for example, 'gpconb' mean tools.

suffix 'ep-' and suffix 'lp-' can be used to mean tense but it can be used for only function.

'epjd A' mean 'thing that imagined A'. 'lpjd' mean 'thing that will imagine A'.

▶grammar{

purpose of this section: making you can know structure of sentence.

* grammar of this language similar to VOS cuz it is efficient for logical language but this language user dont need to use be verb.

* structure of all sentence consist of left hand side and right hand side. in sentence 'A B' if A and B is object then it mean 'B is A'. A is in left hand side. B is in right hand side.

for example, 'anga oe' mean 'i am human'.

anga !r=human.

oe !r=i.//c this,assert,,r this who assert.

* if you didnt speak subject then subject automatically be 'i'. so just saying 'anga' is enough to mean 'i am human'. we use word 'i' lot so this mechanism increace efficiency of language. if you didnt write subject then subject automatically be 'this' so building that is labeled 'restaurant' means that 'this is a restaurant'.

we will learn sentence that have function here.

'jd bd oe' mean 'i am thing that imagine you'.

jd o!r=thing that imagine A.

bd !r=you.//a i,

oe !r=i.//c this,assert,

structure: (jd bd) = oe.

between '(' and ')' is one function.

'jd bd' is one object since function is object.

this grammar can express every meaning. for example, 'The happy boy gives her a small book in the today and smiles.' is expressed as 'mb oihg cd gb if ab elenlkkg nimd lmle ad ab nide mkcd'.

}◀grammar

▶logic{

elca s,o!r=thing that assert that A2 is A1 to B.

we will learn how to say 'i assert to you' here.

bc !si=symbol that omit two parameter.

if you omit two parameter in this function then you can say it. 'elca bc bd' mean 'thing that assert to you'.

▶word 'db'{

db n!r=Ath subject.

'jd db lh oe'

this 'db lh' return first subject. the word 'oe' is in subject so.

so 'db lh' can mean oneself, myself, themselves, youself etc.

dd !r=.//c DB, lh,

'dd' is 'db lb'.

word 'db' that dont have parameter is 'db nh'. 

}◀word 'db'

▶word 'hb'{

hb c o!1p=.

if A is 'hb B C ad'.

A is B is true. A is C is true. A is B and C is true.

if B is pig and C is pencil then A that is animal is only B.

if i am human that is boy then sentence 'i am human' is true but 'boy is me' is false.

if i have pen and dog then element of me is pen is true. pen is element of me is true cuz the value is defined using word 'hb'.

'i am human' is true but 'human is me' is false. 'i am human' mean 'i have property of human' so subject is not smaller concept than direct object but something that is defined by word 'hb' is not. word 'hb' is exact value of possessive and relative pronoun. for example, 'element of D is E' is true. 'E is element of D' is true.

}◀word 'hb'

▶relative pronoun{

'human that i love' is 'human that is what i love'.

'human that love you' is 'human that is thing that love you'. 

you can know why i say it i guess.

▶how to programming using this language{

you can understand well if you know EML and ECL words.

sentence 'A B' command B to be A.

We’ll learn some rules that help me explain it more efficiently.

A ◇ B ◇ C. A is ECL code. B is programming language name. C is code that is wrriten by A.

eg, ja •1 •2 ◇ js ◇ •2 == •1. •1 is first variable. •2 is second variable. in real, you should input variable name instead of •1.

'A ♤ B' mean 'B is explanation of A'.

▶example{

•1 •2 ♤ make variable called •2. assign •1 into •2.

mg •1 •2 •3 ♤ •3 is •1 + •2.

coda •1 ♧ •1 is printed. if right of expression is none then it command to system.

encf •1 •2 ◇ js ◇ if( •2 == •1)

▶word dictionary{

goic s,s,o,c s=for(A2=A1;B;C;){D}.

encf s,c s!v=cmp A2, A1.//in asm,,c by,situation that A2 is A1,

bb o!o=variable A declared with let.//like let A=1;

ib o!o=variable A declared with var.//like var A=1;

fifa c s!r=starting ecl./c command,comand,

lnlf c s!r={A2:A1, A4 : A3}.//c whose,whose,,js's object.

▶word formation rule{

▶'gjfg o,n!r=thing that save A.//c cause, alive'{

antonym of save is kill.

we learned int type parameter.

if bits of word alive and dead is converted into binary, it is 'fojb(1010011110011000) < kjgg(0101100101100110)'.

word alive is smaller than word dead if it is converted into number.

compound word that have antonym is made by word that have smaller bit.

word 'kill' can be 'c cause,dead' but alive have smaller bit than dead so word 'kill' is made as antonym.

}◀

▶'jf s,n!r=result of A2 being A1.//a reason,'{

gc s,n!r=reason why A2 is A2.

'gc' is '0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0'.

'jf' is '1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0'.

word reason is randomly made.

The reason happens before the result, so the word "reason" was created earlier than the word "result." so word reason must have smaller bit than word result.

* antonym should have bigger bit than original word that is randomly made.

}◀


▶'hnmc !r=music.//c sound,pleasure,'{

'sound that i feel pleasure from' is expressed as 'ae hnih mkcd oe'.

but if this word is made by 4 words then people cant know element word.

important word in it is 'hnih'(sound) and 'mkcd'(pleasure).

it is made by the two words.

it is abbreviation.

earlier used word must be earlier so this compound word must be compund word of 'sound' + 'pleasure' instead of 'pleasure' + 'sound'.

}◀

▶'dnfd o,n!r=thing that hate A.//c dread, profit,'{

why this word is not made by antonym.

if it is made by antonym then it is dnke so form and sound of it is similar to dfke and meaning of dfke similar to love cuz it mean thing that dread that something become victim.
