Among the people I’ve seen, those who dislike this language didn’t even properly read this document. if this language can become more perfect then this language is changed.

this language is most versatile and most efficient most logical and unambiguous and easy and simple language.

this language can help cheating in exam because it takes up very little space and most people won't think of it as a language, so it won't get caught.

imagine what if this language version of QR code replace pictogram. we dont need to learn lot of pictogram.
  </pre>
  <img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/hatepictogram.jpg" alt="connect error">
  <pre>

 if this language become international language then everybody can easily communicate with disabled person and blind and the deaf since this language can easily be converted into this language version of braille and sign language and morse code and barcode and QR code and etc by simple rule by being binary language. it is very very easy and simple so you can do many things by learning this language.

if all human use this language environmental pollution will be reduced.

The prevention of environmental pollution through this language is enormous scale.

most data in world is video data but if someone speak in this language, the someone dont need to speak for long time so video become short.

A sentence that takes 10 seconds to say in English can be said in just 5 seconds in this language.

this language is very consistent so polution by AI and LLM will be reduced.
    
An ambiguous IAL creates misunderstandings and promotes conflict.

unlogical IAL make mankind uncivilized.

this language use phonetic script but this language is pronounced differently from english and it is easy to pronounce and unambiguous. this language can express all pronunciation using parameter.

most words are not randomly made.

lot of words is compound words.(eg word 'hnmb' mean music. word 'hnmb' is compound word of sound and fun. word 'bomb' mean sports. it is compound word of compete and fun)

lot of words is abbreviations.(word 'nd' is abbreviation for 'Na Doea'(this time). this word mean now)

lot of words are arranged in an orderly way.(eg bihd mean hydrogen(Atomic number 1). cihd mean helium(Atomic number 2). dihd mean lithium(Atomic number 3). eihd mean beryllium(Atomic number 4))

so it help technology grow cuz it make science easy.

Words used in similar situations or words with similar meanings are made of similar letters. eg mjob mean love. mkib mean like. mkcb mean pleasure so you can easily guess the meaning of abbreviation you see for the first time.

lot of antonym is made by word formation rule for antonym.

this language have very few suffix.(maybe 4)

part of speech of this language is only three.

if you learn a little grammar, then you can explain every meaning, regardless of your native language. grammar is simplest and consistent by using  prefix notation so this language can be used in programming without change of grammar. the programming language is called 'pmfa'. other programming languages have limits. For example, C++ cannot represent numbers beyond a certain size, but pmfa can represent all number.

Word stress is not required for word distinction in this language.

NLQR1 is this language version of barcode. NLQR1 is most efficient 1D code. it is usually four times more efficient than barcode. barcode use 145cell to mention 'i am person' but NLQR1 use 28cell.
</pre>
  <img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/vsbar.jpg" alt="connect error">
  <pre>
NLQR2 is this language version of QR code. QR codes can only store about 3KB or less of data unlike NLQR. NLQR2 is most efficient 2D code. NLQR2 is usually over 4 times more efficient than a QR code. eg QR code use 441cell to mention 'i am person' but NLQR2 use 32cell.
  </pre>
  <img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/vsqr.jpg" alt="connect error">
  <pre>
NLQR mean NLQR1, NLQR2, NLQR3. all NLQR have finder pattern so it can be accurately decoded from any orientation. all NLQR is human readable.
  </pre>
  <img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/principlenlqr.jpg" alt="connect error">
  <pre>
NLQR3 is most efficient code.
  </pre>
  <img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/nlqrs.jpg" alt="connect error">
  <pre>

this language can be unambiguous interpreted without whitespace so it deosnt need hassle mark eg whitespace and hyphen.
    
NL morse is this language version of morse code. NL Morse is usually two times more efficient than Morse code. morse code cant explain mathmatical expression but NL morse can express all meaning. 'i love you' in morse code is following:

.. / .-.. --- ...- . / -.-- --- ..-

in veluil:

..---.....-- / .-...--

NL braille is this language version of braille. NL braille is usually 1.5 times more efficient than braille. original Braille is ambiguous cuz meaning of original braille depending on direction but NL braille can have same meaning in any direction.

Sign language is difficult or inefficient for expressing new words or slang but this language's sign language is not.

this language is efficient. efficient is necessary to be versatile.

keyboard that is for this language is easy to type cuz it has only 2~16letter.
  </pre>
  <img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/easykeyboard.jpg" alt="connect error">
  <pre>

english easly becomes ambiguous. eg 'i love situation that i love person who love cow and people and chicken or he eat meal'. but this language express all situation without ambiguous.

word think have three meaning it is imagine and beilive and ponder so word for think is not exist in this language.

this language dont have slang.

this language doesn't have exceptions.

this language dont have homonyms and synonyms.

unambigous is very good for language cuz it make efficient cuz it doesn't need any additional explanation or images to explain exactly.

'i know you' is 80bit in ascii code. this language need 16bit to say 'i know you'.

concerns: lot of words are arranged in an orderly way? so 'foea' mean minute. 'goea' mean hour but the pronunciation is similar so it is hard to distinguish in noisy place.

refute: I recorded 'foea', 'goea', and 'hoea'. Then, I played the video in a noisy place to see whether I could recognize them exaxtly. They were very easy to distinguish. It won't be a problem if you well pronounce them.

concerns: i hate this wrting system. it cant explain interjection and foreign word.

refute: no, this writing system can express interjection and foreign word using specific parameter type. if we change alphabet then we cant use world most efficient system(NLQR, NLmorse). this alphabet make we can easily pronunce all that can be expressed as binary so we can pronunce 🕎 without learning name.

other refute to concerns is appear when explain new thing. Even if I refute it now, you won’t know what I’m talking about. if there are problem we can change.

we have some tool. i belive that it can be evidence.

site for searching word: https://fhres126.github.io/w/worddictionary.html

this following video explain principle of this language. i belive that it can be evidence.

Language is extremely important because it makes humans superior. A language must not be inferior, and it must not hinder science, scholarship, or other fields. i made this language using this thought.

▶alphabet{

* this language use only 0 and 1. it can be expressed as this follwing 16 letter.
</pre>
<img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/efficientalphabet.jpg" alt="connect error">
<pre>
 it in unicode:
. | : ᴦ 
⠍ ⎛ ꜒ >
ㅏ ㅇ 7 ᓱ
P = ⵎ 0

braille is 2×3 and this alphabet is 2×3 so this alphabet can be used as braille. but other braille for this language is exist for efficient.

if the alphabet cant be used then it can be expressed by latin alphabet.

a = 0000. b = 1000. c = 0100. d = 1100.

e = 0010. f = 1010. g = 0110. h = 1110.

i = 0001. j = 1001. k = 0101. l = 1101.

m = 0011. n = 1011. o = 0111. p = 1111.

}◀alphabet




▶word separation, spacing{

purpose of this section: making you can distinguish border of words.

* one word consist of 8n bits.

* 8n-th bit that is zero is end of word.

it play role of whitespace of english so this language dont need whitespace.

eg '11111110' is one word.

* 8n-th bit 1 make the word consist of more bit.

'11111111 11111110' is one word.

this language dont need whitespace but i will use whitespace to make you easily understand.

quiz: How many words does this sentense have?

'mkfdbdoe'.

(1) 1.
(2) 2.
(3) 3.

answer: 3.

}◀word separation, spacing




▶pronunciation{

purpose of this section: making you know how to pronunce binary.

* Two letters make one syllable.

* odd numbered letter is pronounced as initial consonant. 
* even numbered letter is pronounced as vowel and final consonant.

eg 'bb anba' is pronounced as [ bo membu ].

if 'b' is in odd numbered letter then it pronounced as 'b'.

if 'b' is in even numbered letter then it is pronounced as 'o'.

in pronunciation chart, 'b' is expressed as follwing.

b = /b/, /o/,

then 'anba' is pronounced as 'membu' then it can be simplified as 'meb'.

this language can express all pronunciation using specific parameter.

pronunciation chart is follwing:

a = /m/, /u/. b = /b/, /o/, . c = /d/, /ʌ/. d = /g/, /ɯ/.

e = /n/, /a/. f = /ɾ/, /ɛ/. g = /p͈/, /i/. h = /t͈/, /wʌ/.

i = /k͈/, /um/. j = /p/, /om/. k = /t/, /ʌm/. l = /k/, /ɯm/.

m = /tɕ/, /am/. n = /t͈ɕ/, /ɛm/. o = /t͡ʃ/, /im/. p: /s/, /wɛ/.

▶read it if you dislike this pronunciation{

initial consonant that is easy to distinguish is 19.

/m/, /b/, /d/, /g/, /n/, /l/, /p͈/, /t͈/, /k͈/, /p/, /t/, /k/, /tɕ/, /tɕ͈/, /tɕʰ/, /s/, /s͈/, /∅/ ,/h/.

vowel that is easy to distinguish is 10.

/u/, /o/, /ʌ/, /ɯ/, /a/, /ɛ/, /i/, /wʌ/, /wi/, /wɛ/.

silent final consonant and h aren't used cuz it make problem.

The pronunciation [ma] is made by quickly saying [m] and [a].

The pronunciation [ta] is made by quickly saying [d] and [ha].

sometime we can interpret 'ta' as 'd ha' if we talk slowly.

if word is long then there are final consonant. This mechanism makes long word difficult to say so user dont wanna made long word so it becomes efficient.

pronuncing binary make we can pronunce all without learning name.

the pronunciation is arranged with lower Hz sounds coming first. so it is not biased toward any specific culture.

you can learn using quickly learn section or slowly learn section.

▶slowly learn(not finished but can helpful){

word 'anga' mean 'human'. and in word dictionary, it is expressed as follwing.

anga !r=human.

this is called word dictionary formular. word dictionary formular is for efficiently explaining words. the 'r' is in place for explaining word type. the 'r' mean 'realty' so this word type is 'reality'. only thing that can be in reality must be reality type word.

word 'nb' mean 'i' and 'me'. it is abbreviation for 'Na Blca'(this who assert). and in word dictionary, it is expressed as following.

nb !r=i.//c this, assert,

additional explanation is in right of the dot. you should see additional explaination to easily remember word.

in this lecture, i wont use word that i didnt teach.

sentence 'anga nb' mean 'i am human'. the word 'anga' is in left hand side. the word 'nb' is in right hand side. if you didnt speak right hand side then right hand side automatically be 'i'. so just speaking 'anga' is enough to assert 'i am human'. we use word 'i' lot so this mechanism increace efficiency of language. if you didnt write right hand side then right hand side automatically be 'this' so building that is labeled 'restaurant' means that 'this is a restaurant'.

here we will learn function word. you should know object mean noun or function. word 'fc' is function that must have two object type parameter. word 'fc' is abbreviation for 'fa kf'. 'fa kf' mean 'thing that command to answer'. and in word dictionary, it is expressed as following.

fc o,o!r=thing that ask x2 about x1.//c command,answer,//e omitted x2 is you.

the 'o' is in place for explaining parameter that function must have. the 'o' is abbreviation for 'object' so object can be inputed in this function as parameter.

the x1 that is in between equal sign and dot must be changed into first input value. x2 must be changed into second input value. x3 must be changed into third input value... 'fc anga nb' mean 'thing that ask me about human'. '//e' is used to explain word using sentence. the x2 mean second parameter.

all sentence of this language consist of left hand side and right hand side. 

in sentence 'fc anga nb nb', parameter of 'fc' is full so this function cant have manier parameter so place for left hand side is done. you must remember this mechanism to recognize what is left hand side and right hand side and one sentence.

here we will learn how to say 'what is your name?' so we need to learn word for of and word for name and word for you.

word 'af' mean 'of'. this word must have two object as parameter. type of word 'af' is type of first input parameter. this word is expressed as following in word dictionary.

af o,o!1p=x1 of x2.//c A that is B, element of A,//r pencil that is element of me is pencil of me.

the '1p' mean type of this word is type of first input parameter.

additional explanation '//r' is used to explaining why this word is made in this way.

word 'blga' mean name. meaning of name similar to meaning of code so form of word for name similar to word for code. '//s code,' that is in additional explanation mean form of this word similar to word for code. word for name is expressed as following in word dictionary.

blga !r=name.//s code,

word for you is antonym of me. this word is made by word formation rule for antonym. form of antonym is inversed bit from original word. for example, antonym of me('nb'(10111000)) is you('cg'(01000110)). 8n-th bit must not be changed by being word separation code. and the word is expressed as following in word dictionary.

cg !r=you.//a me,

this word can be expressed as diffrent way. capital letter that is in additional explanation is this language word so this word dictionary formular can be expressed as following.

cg !r=you.//a NB,

sentnece 'fc af blga cg' mean 'i am thing that ask you about name of you' as well as 'i ask you about name of you' as well as 'what is your name?'.

you can use word 'kf' to answer.

kf o,o!r=thing that answer x1 to x2.//a ask,//e omitted B is you.

sentence 'kf bicc' mean 'i am thing that answer bicc to you' as well as 'i reply you to bicc' as well as 'it is bicc'.

sentence 'gillpa af blga nb' mean 'my name is gillpa' but you can omit second parameter of word 'af'.

here we will learn how to say 'where is bathroom?'.

ne o!r=location of x1.

nnfd !r=bathroom.//c place,emit,shit,

sentence 'fc ne nnfd' mean 'i am thing that ask you about location of bathroom' as well as 'i ask you about location of bathroom' as well as 'where is bathroom?'.

here we will learn how to say hello.

olga o!r=thing that greet x1.//s call,

od o!r=thing that call x1.

form of this word is similar in binary. this language dont need word 'hello' and 'hey'. sentence 'olga' mean 'hello' and 'i am thing that greet'. sentence 'od' mean 'hey' and 'i am thing that call'.

bjjh o!r=thing that bye x1.//a greet,

you can use this word to bye.

we will learn how to say 'do you have water?'.

word 'ja' must have sentence as parameter. sentence type parameter is just 'o,o'. this word is expressed as following in word dictionary.

ja o,o!r=whether x2 is x1.

ke o!r=thing that have x1.//a element,

goda !r=water.//s liquid,

sentence 'fc ja ke goda cg' mean 'i am thing that ask you about whether you are thing that have water' as well as 'i ask you about whether you have water' as well as 'do you have water?'.

here we wiĺl learn how to say 'give me water'.

fa o,o!r=thing that command x2 to be x1.//e omitted A2 is you.

gb o,o,n!r=thing that cause x2 be x1.//e C is degree of cause.

sentence 'fa gb ke goda nb' mean 'i am thing that command you to be thing that cause me be thing that have water' as well as 'make me thing that have water!' as well as 'give me water'. 

here we will learn how to say 'thank you'.

mood o,n!r=thing that thank x1.//e x2 is degree of thank.

sentence 'mood cg' mean 'thank you'.

word 'mjib' must have object and number as parameter. the number is for explainng degree of like.

mjib o,n!r=thing that like x1.//s love,//e B is degree of like.

in sentence 'mjib anga nb', second parameter of word 'mjib' automatically be omitted by other type word. this sentence mean 'i am thing that like you'. the degree of like is expressed as number between zero and one. word 'lh' mean one so sentence 'mjib cg lh nb' mean 'I like you with 100% intensity'.

word 'ea' is 'what' as in 'what you like'. word 'ea' return n-th parameter. word 'lh' is one so 'ea lh' return first parameter.

in sentence 'mjib anga cg', the word 'anga' is in first parameter of the sentence so 'ea lh mjib cg' return 'anga'. it mean 'what you like'. word 'ea' that dont have number type parameter automatically return first parameter.

if word 'ea' target second parameter of word 'mjib' then we can say 'how much you like human'.

nh !n=two.

'ea nh mjib anga cg' mean 'how much you like human'.

lb o!r=thing that know x1.

word 'pb' causes the parameter at the same position to be returned. in sentence 'mjib anga cg', word 'anga' is in first parameter so 'ea mjib pb cg' is 'anga'.

word 'pc' causes the sentence at the same position to be returned.

lf o,o!r=thing that belive x2 is x1.//c know,as,true,whether,

'ea lf pc cg' mean 'your belief'.

here we will learn comparative.

jkca n!r=Ameter.

bb o!n=thing that is less than x1.

in 'jkca bb lh'  mean 'meter whose parameter is less than one' and 'thing that is shorter than one meter'.

'jkca bb ea jkca nb' mean 'thing that is shorter than me'. it can be simplified as 'jkca bb nb'. and there are abbreviation.

jkbb o!r=thing that is shorter than x1.//c meter,less,

og o!n=thing that is more than x1.//a less,

'jkca og nb' mean 'thing that is longer than me'.

gnog o!r=thing that is longer than x1.//a short,

sentence 'mjib nb og cg nb' mean 'i am thing that like me than you'.

pg o!n=x1 that is converted into number.

'jkca pg nb' mean 'thing that is same height as me'.

we learn this language so lets learn how to say 'i learn veluil'.

mmlb o!r=thing that learn x1.//c becoming,know,

pmag !r=veluil.

so sentence 'mmlb pmag nb' mean 'i am thing that learn veluil'.

here we will learn how to say 'can you speak veluil?'.

lg o,n!p=thing that can be x1 with x2 percent probability.

hnda o,o!r=thing that speak x1 to x2.//c sound,mention,

sentence 'fc ja lg hnda pmag' mean 'i am thing that ask you about wheter you are thing that can be thing that speak veluil'.

ff !r=true.

sentence 'kf ff' mean 'i am thing that answer you to true' and 'yes'.

here we will learn how to say number.

word 'kg' is for explainng decimal number.

kg dec!n=.//e this word is for explainng decimal number.

binary that is in dec type parameter is not word. 'b' that is in dec type parameter is 1. 'a' that is in dec type parameter finish dec type parameter.

'kg ba' mean 'one'.

c is 2. d is 3. e is 4. f is 5. g is 6. h is 7. i is 8. j is 9. k is 0.

this language use little andian so 'kg bcdefgka' mean '654321'.

we can say some number shortly.

ih !n=zero.

lh !n=one.

nh !n=two.

ph !n=three.

jh !n=four.

kh !n=minus one.

mh !n=minus two.

oh !n=minus three.

we will learn how to say 'meet at 9a.m!'.

word 'goea' mean hour. type of this word is time. this word is next word of word for minute. next word is one bit higher than before word. 

goea n!t=x1 hour.//n minute,

'//n minute' mean 'this word is next word of word for minute'.

foea n!t=x1 minute.//n second,

mc t,o!2p=thing that is x2 when x1.

nnad o!r=thing that met x1.//a around,

sentence 'fa mc goea kg ja nnad' mean 'meet at 9a.m!'.

we will learn how to say 'at that time, i see you'.

word 'pf' can be inputed in every parameter by being object type word.

pf !o=it.

if word 'pf' is inputed in time type parameter then this word must be time so word 'pf' that is in time type parameter is translated as 'that time'.

lica o!r=thing that see x1.//c sense,photon,

sentence 'mb pf lica cg nb' mean 'i am thing that see you at that time'.

here we will learn how to say 'can you speak it agian?'.

lg o,n!p=thing that can be x1 with x2 percent probability.

imea n,o!1p=thing that repeat x2 at x1 times.

in sentence 'fc ja lg imea hnda pf', there are no word for you. omitted parameter is determined by context. this sentence mean 'i am thing that ask you about whether you are thing that can be thing that repeat be thing that speak it'.

here we will learn tense.

ed o!1p=thing that was x1.

sentence 'ed mjib cg nb' mean 'i was thing that like you'.

suffix ep- mean was. this suffix can be used for only function.

sentence 'epmjib cg nb' mean 'i was thing that like you'.

}◀slowly learn

























▶quickly learn(not finished but can be helpful. for smart){

this section quickly teach so remember all that is in this section.

grammar is easy so learning words is impotant so we will learn how to interpret word dictionary formular firstly.

word 'anga' mean 'human'. and in word dictionary, it is expressed as follwing.

anga !r=human.

this is called word dictionary formular. word dictionary formular is for efficiently explaining words. the 'r' is in place for explaining word type. the 'r' mean 'realty' so this word type is 'reality'. only thing that can be in reality must be reality type word.

word 'nb' mean 'i' and 'me'. it is abbreviation for 'Na Blca'(this who assert). and in word dictionary, it is expressed as following.

nb !r=i.//c this, assert,

additional explanation is in right of the dot. you should see additional explaination to easily remember word.

in this lecture, i wont use word that i didnt teach.

we will learn function word here. you should know object mean noun or function. word 'fc' is function that must have two object type parameter. word 'fc' is abbreviation for 'fa kf'. 'fa kf' is 'thing that command to answer'. and in word dictionary, it is expressed as following.

fc o,o!r=thing that ask x2 about x1.//c command,answer,//e omitted B is you.

the 'o' is in place for explaining parameter that function must have. the 'o' is abbreviation for 'object' so object can be inputed in this function as parameter.

the capital letter in between equal sign and dot must be changed into input value. A must be changed into first input value. B must be changed into second input value. C must be changed into third input value... 'fc anga nb' mean 'thing that ask me about human'. '//e' is used to explain word using sentence.

▶parameter dictionary{

'o' is abbreviation for object.

'n' is abbreviation for number.

't' is abbreviation for time.

'what' is 'what' as in 'what i know'.

ea what!r=.

word 'ea' return n-th parameter.

lh !n=one.

jd o!r=thing that imagine x1.

'ea lh' return first parameter in sentence. 'ea lh jd oe' return first parameter of word 'jd' so it mean what i imagine. if there are no number then it automatically return first parameter. word 'pa' can be used. 'ea jd pa oe' mean 'what i imagine'.

'int' is binary string that consist of integer multiple of 8 bits. for example,

blfa int!r=word x1.

object that is inputed in this function dont have parameter.

'dec' is for saying decimal number. 4bits in parameter is one decimal number.

for example,

kg dec!n=.

'a' finish parameter dec. 'b' is 1. 'c' is 2. 'd' is 3. 'e' is 4. 'f' is 5. 'g' is 6. 'h' is 7. 'i' is 8. 'j' is 9. 'k' is 0 since if 'a' is '0' it cant be visible in NLQR. this language use little andian so 'fg bcdeghka' is 7654321.

be c o!1p=1x1 and 2x1 and...

parameter 'c A' mean this word have parameter until this word met symbol that omit parameter.

'be x1 x2 x3 ad' mean 'x1 and x2 and x3'.

}◀parameter dictionary




▶addiotional explanation dictionary{

'//a A' mean 'this word is antonym of A'. The antonym form is the inversion of the original word's bits. 0 becomes 1. 1 becomes 0. for example, antonym of 
'oojb'(01110111,10011000) is 
'bjgg'(10001001,01100110). '//a alive,' is '//a OOJB,'. 8n-th bit dont be changed since it is for explaining length of word.

'//n A' mean this word is next word of A.  for example,

hoea n!t=A hour.//n minute,

goea n!t=A minute.//n second,

the letter is increaced. g into h.

'//c A, B,' mean this word consist of A and B. if there are it then this word is compound word or abbreviation. for example,

nd !t=now.//c this, time,

this word is abbreviation for 'Na Deoa'(this time).

'//d A,' mean this word is made in time A. 

'//e A,' mean explanation of this word is A.

'//u A,' mean form of this word is changed in time A.

'//p A, B,' mean pronunciation of this word similar to A in language B.

'//s A, B,' mean form of this word similar to word A in language B. if there are no B then the word is derived from this language.

▶word type dictionary{

'si' type word dont impact to grammar defautly. for example, line break is si type.

n mean number.

r mean reality.

t mean time.

▶suffix{

suffix 'gp-' make word into plural. for example, 'gpconb' mean tools.

suffix 'ep-' and suffix 'lp-' can be used to mean tense but it can be used for only function.

'epjd A' mean 'thing that imagined A'. 'lpjd' mean 'thing that will imagine A'.

suffix 'ip-' mean '-tion'.

▶language for memory{

▶grammar{

purpose of this section: making you can know structure of sentence.

all sentence of this language consist of left hand side and right hand side. 

in sentence 'fc anga nb nb', parameter of 'fc' is full so this function cant have manier parameter so place for left hand side is done. you must remember this mechanism to recognize what is left hand side and right hand side and one sentence.

}◀grammar




▶logic{

blca o,o,o!r=thing that assert that x2 is x1 to x3.

we will learn how to say 'i assert to you' here.

bc !si=symbol that omit two parameter.

if you omit two parameter in this function then you can say it. 'blca bc cg' mean 'thing that assert to you'.

▶word 'db'{

db n!r=x1-th right hand side.

'jd db lh nb'

this 'db lh' return first subject. the word 'nb' is in subject so.

so 'db lh' can mean oneself, myself, themselves, youself etc.

dd !r=.//c DB, lh,

'dd' is 'db lb'.

word 'db' that dont have parameter is 'db nh'.

'human that i love' is 'human that is what i love'.

'human that love you' is 'human that is thing that love you'.

▶how to programming using this language{

the programming language is like machine language.

sentence command right hand side to be left hand side.

'lh gh' mean that 'gh is one' so it is how to define value.

here we will learn how to make an IDE generate characters.

dida o,o!r=thing that mention A to B.

in sentence 'dida gh bc', right hand side is omitted so this sentence command to this document.

here we will learn if statement.

cnjf o,o, c (o,o)!t=.//e if B is A then C is played.

sentence 'cnjf gh lh dida gh cc' mean 'if gh is one then say value in gh'.

}◀how to programming using this language




▶word formation rule{

The reason happens before the result, so the word "reason" was created earlier than the word "result." so word reason must have smaller bit than word result. antonym should have bigger bit than original word that is randomly made.

'sound that average human feel pleasure from' is expressed as 'ae hnib mjcb kd anga'. but if this word is made by 5 words then most people dont know element word or the word would be very long. important word in it is 'hnib'(sound) and 'mjcb'(pleasure). it is made by the two words. it is abbreviation. earlier used word must be earlier so this compound word must be compund word of 'sound' + 'pleasure' instead of 'pleasure' + 'sound'.

why this word is not made by word formation rule for antonym.

if pronunciation of antonym similar to original word then the word is made as compound word.

mjob o,n!r=thing that love x1.//c hope,profit,

doob o,n!r=thing that hate x1.//c dread, profit,

word for hate didnt be made by word formation rule for antonym. pronunciation of 'dobg' similar to 'dgbg'. meaning of dgbg similar to love cuz it mean thing that dread that something become victim.
