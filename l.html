This artificial language is called veluil(Versatile Efficient Logical Unambiguous International Language) in English.

▶advantage of this language{

this language is most versatile and most efficient and most logical unambiguous eco-friendly language.

This language has many advantages, so I will explain them in three parts: versatility, logic, and efficiency.

▶examples of the versatile{

this language version of barcodes is exist and it is called NLQR1. NLQR1 is most efficient 1D code. it is usually four times more efficient than barcode. barcode use 145cell to mention 'i am person' but NLQR1 use 28cell.
</pre>
  <img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/vsbar.jpg" alt="connect error">
  <pre>
this language version of QR code is exist and it is called NLQR2. NLQR2 is most efficient 2D code. NLQR2 is usually over 4 times more efficient than a QR code. eg QR code use 441cell to mention 'i am person' but NLQR2 use 32cell.
  </pre>
  <img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/vsqr.jpg" alt="connect error">
  <pre>
NLQR mean NLQR1, NLQR2, NLQR3. meaning of all NLQR is Not affected by direction, like a QR code.
  </pre>
  <img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/principlenlqr.jpg" alt="connect error">
  <pre>
NLQR3 is most efficient code.
  </pre>
  <img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/nlqrs.jpg" alt="connect error">
  <pre>
NLQR can help cheating in exam because it is human-readble. it takes up little space and most people won't think of it as a language, so it won't get caught.

imagine what if NLQR replace pictogram. we dont need to learn lot of pictogram.
  </pre>
  <img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/hatepictogram.jpg" alt="connect error">
  <pre>
this language version of morse code is exist and it is called NL morse. NL Morse is usually two times more efficient than Morse code. morse code cant explain mathmatical expression but NL morse can express all meaning.

this language version of braille is exist and it is called NL braille. NL braille is usually 1.5 times more efficient than braille. original Braille is ambiguous cuz meaning of original braille depending on direction but NL braille can have same meaning in any direction.

Sign language is difficult or inefficient for expressing new words or slang but this language's sign language is not.

this language is a binary language so it can easily be converted into NLQR and NL morse and NL braille and sign language and minecraft language and etc. you can learn it easily so you can do many things by learning this language so person who learn this language can easily communicate with the blind and the deaf.

this language is efficient. efficient is necessary to be versatile.

keyboard that is for this language is easy to type cuz it has only 2~16letter.
  </pre>
  <img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/easykeyboard.jpg" alt="connect error">
  <pre>
this language can be unambiguous interpreted without whitespace so it deosnt need hassle mark eg whitespace and hyphen.

}◀example of the versatile

▶example of the easy{

this language use phonetic script but this language is pronounced differently from english and it is easy to pronounce and unambiguous. this language can express all pronunciation using parameter.

most words are not randomly made.

lot of words is compound words.(eg word 'hnmc' mean music. word 'hnmc' is compound word of sound and fun. word 'bomc' mean sports. it is compound word of compete and fun)

lot of words is abbreviations.(eg word 'od' mean now. word 'od' is abbreviation for 'Oa Doea'(this time))

lot of words are arranged in an orderly way.(eg bihd mean hydrogen(Atomic number 1). cihd mean helium(Atomic number 2). dihd mean lithium(Atomic number 3). eihd mean beryllium(Atomic number 4))

so it help technology grow cuz it make science easy.

Words used in similar situations or words with similar meanings are made of similar letters. eg mkfd mean love. mkid mean like. mkcd mean pleasure so you can easily guess the meaning of abbreviation you see for the first time.

lot of antonym is made by word formation rule for antonym.

this language have very few suffix.(maybe 4)

part of speech of this language is only noun and function.

if you learn a little grammar, then you can explain every meaning, regardless of your native language. grammar is simplest and consistent by using  prefix notation so this language can be used in programming without change of grammar. the programming language is called 'pmfa'. other programming languages have limits. For example, C++ cannot represent numbers beyond a certain size, but pmfa can represent all number.

Word stress is not required for word distinction in this language.

}◀example of the easy

▶example of the logical{

english easly becomes ambiguous. eg 'i love situation that i love person who love cow and people and chicken or he eat meal'. but this language express all situation without ambiguous.

word think have three meaning it is imagine and beilive and ponder so word for think is not exist in this language.

this language dont have slang.

this language doesn't have exceptions.

this language dont have homonyms and synonyms.

unambigous is very good for language cuz it make efficient cuz it doesn't need any additional explanation or images to explain exactly.

}◀example of the logical

▶example of the efficient{

'i know you' is 80bit in ascii code. 'i know you' in this language is 'lbbd' it is 16bit. this language can express all using only binary. and one letter is just for only expressing 4bit so it is 16bit.

}◀example of the efficient
  
▶why this language must be IAL{
    
if all human use this language environmental pollution will be reduced.

The prevention of environmental pollution through this language is enormous scale.

most data in world is video data but if someone speak in this language, the someone dont need to speak for long time so video become short.

A sentence that takes 10 seconds to say in English can be said in just 5 seconds in this language.

this language is very consistent so polution by AI and LLM will be reduced.
    
An ambiguous IAL creates misunderstandings and promotes conflict.
    
it make easy communication between disabled people and non-disabled.

unlogical IAL make mankind uncivilized.
    
}◀why this language must be IAL

}◀advantage of this language

Among the people I’ve seen, those who dislike this language didn’t even properly read this document.

▶refute to concerns{

concerns: lot of words are arranged in an orderly way? so 'foea' mean minute. 'goea' mean hour but the pronunciation is similar so it is hard to distinguish in noisy place.

refute: I recorded 'foea', 'goea', and 'hoea'. Then, I played the video in a noisy place to see whether I could recognize them exaxtly. They were very easy to distinguish. It won't be a problem if you well pronounce them.

concerns: i hate this wrting system. it cant explain interjection and foreign word.

refute: no, this writing system can express interjection and foreign word using specific parameter type. if we change alphabet then we cant use world most efficient system(NLQR, NLmorse). this alphabet make we can easily pronunce all that can be expressed as binary so we can pronunce 🕎 without learning name.

other refute to concerns is appear when explain new thing. Even if I refute it now, you won’t know what I’m talking about.

▶alphabet{

* this language use only 0 and 1. it can be expressed as 16 latin letter.

a = 0000. b = 1000. c = 0100. d = 1100.

e = 0010. f = 1010. g = 0110. h = 1110.

i = 0001. j = 1001. k = 0101. l = 1101.

m = 0011. n = 1011. o = 0111. p = 1111.

this language uses only lowercase letters.

more efficient alphabet is here:
</pre>
<img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/efficientalphabet.jpg" alt="connect error">
<pre>
 it in unicode:
. | : ᴦ 
⠍ ⎛ ꜒ >
ㅏ ㅇ 7 ᓱ
P = ⵎ 0

braille is 2×3 and this alphabet is 2×3 so this alphabet can be used as braille. but other braille for this language is exist for efficient.

}◀alphabet

▶word separation, spacing{

purpose of this section: making you can distinguish border of words.

* one word consist of 8n bits.

* 8n-th bit that is zero is end of word.

it play role of whitespace of english so this language dont need whitespace.

eg '11111110' is one word.

* 8n-th bit 1 make the word consist of more bit.

'11111111 11111110' is one word.

this language dont need whitespace but i will use whitespace to make you easily understand.

quiz: How many words does this sentense have?

'mkfdbdoe'.

(1) 1.
(2) 2.
(3) 3.

answer: 3.

}◀word separation, spacing

▶pronunciation{

purpose of this section: making you know how to pronunce binary.

* Two letters make one syllable.

* (2n-1)th letter is pronounced as initial consonant. 

* 2n-th letter is pronounced as vowel and final consonant.

eg 'bb anba' is pronounced as [ bo membu ].

if 'b' is in (2n-1)-th letter then it pronounced as 'b'.

if 'b' is in 2n-th letter then it is pronounced as 'o'.

in pronunciation chart, 'b' is 'b' and 'o'.

then 'anba' is pronounced as 'membu' then it can be simplified as 'meb'.

this language can express all pronunciation using specific parameter.

▶pronunciation chart{

the pronunciation is arranged with lower Hz sounds coming first. so it is not biased toward any specific culture.

▶IPA version{

a = /m/, /u/. b = /b/, /o/, . c = /d/, /ʌ/. d = /g/, /ɯ/.

e = /n/, /a/. f = /ɾ/, /ɛ/. g = /p͈/, /i/. h = /t͈/, /wʌ/.

i = /k͈/, /um/. j = /p/, /om/. k = /t/, /ʌm/. l = /k/, /ɯm/.

m = /tɕ/, /am/. n = /t͈ɕ/, /ɛm/. o = /t͡ʃ/, /im/. p: /s/, /wɛ/.

}◀IPA version

}◀pronunciation chart

▶read it if you dislike this pronunciation{

initial consonant that is easy to distinguish is 19.

vowel that is easy to distinguish is 10.

silent final consonant and h aren't used cuz it make problem.

The pronunciation [ma] is made by quickly saying [m] and [a].

The pronunciation [ta] is made by quickly saying [d] and [ha].

sometime we can interpret 'ta' as 'd ha' if we talk slowly.

if word is long then there are final consonant 'm'.

This mechanism makes long word difficult to say so user dont wanna made long word so it becomes efficient.

pronuncing binary make we can pronunce all without learning name.

explaing logical language using unlogical language is difficult so sometime i will use this language to explain this language so you should well understand so i need to teach how to interpret word dictionary to make me efficiently explain. here is basic.

▶How to interpret a word dictionary{

purpose of this section: making you know basic how to interpret word dictionary.

fojb !r=alive thing.

word is expressed as it in word dictionary.

* far left is this language word.

* between '!' and '=' is word type.

* right of '=' is meaning of this word.

* 'r' is an abbreviation for 'reality'. it is type of only word that is not number or etc.

ih !n=zero.

the 'n' is abbreviation for number. type of this word is number.

doea !t=time.

the 't' is abbreviation for time. type of this word is time.

jd o!r=thing that imagine A.

between this language word and '!' is parameter type that this function must have. if it is exist then this word should have parameter.

'o' is an abbreviation for 'object' so all object can be inputed in this function.

there are capital letter in right of '='. A is first inputed value. B is second inputed value. C is third inputed value... change the capital letter to inputed value of function.

eg 'jd bd' mean 'thing that imagine you' cuz 'bd' mean 'you'.

of o,o!r=thing that go from B to A.

B is second inputed parameter. third is C.

'of ajoa fodg' mean 'thing that go from house to here' cuz 'ajoa' mean 'here'. 'fodg' mean 'house'.

Q: this word should have parameter so how to say 'i dont know word imagine' in this language?

A: it is 'eb lb elfa jd', word in parameter of 'elfa' deosnt have parameter.

kjgg !r=dead thing.//a alive,

'//' is for an additional explanation.

'a' is an abbreviation for 'antonym'.

* 'a A' mean 'this word is antonym of A'.

* The antonym form is the inversion of the original word's bits. 0 becomes 1. 1 becomes 0.

eg antonym of 
'fojb'(10100111,10011000) is 
'kjgg'(01011001,01100110).

8n-th bit dont be changed since it is for explaining length of word.

}◀How to interpret a word dictionary

▶quickly learn{

▶structure of sentence{

purpose of this section: making you can know structure of sentence.

* word order of this language similar to VOS cuz it is efficient for logical grammar. but this language use function instead of verb.

* if A and B is noun then sentence 'A B' mean 'B is A'. 

for example, 'fojb' mean 'alive thing' and it is noun. 'oe' mean 'i' and it is noun. so 'fojb oe' mean 'i am alive'.

* all direct object is called parameter. direct object must attach to transitive verb.

'jd bd oe' mean 'i am thing that imagine you' and 'i imagine you'.

structure: (jd bd) = oe.

between '(' and ')' is one function.

'jd bd' is one object since function is object.

* if subject is omitted, subject is 'i' so sentence 'jd bd' mean sentence 'jd bd oe'.

we use word 'i' lot so this mechanism increace efficiency of language. but i wont omit subject to make you easily understand.

this grammar can express every meaning. eg 'The happy boy gives her a small book in the today and smiles.' is expressed as 'mb oihg cd gb if ab elellkkg nimd lmle ad ab nide mkcd'.

▶what 'jd ad oe' mean?{

jd o!r=thing that imagine A.

ad !si=symbol that omit one parameter.

oe !r=i.//c this,assert,,r this who assert

(1) i imagine.
(2) imagine me!
(3) i imagine me.
(4) imagine of me.

parameter of 'jd' is omitted by 'ad'.

if parameter is omitted, it means 'something'.

answer: (1)

free translation: 'i imagine'.

structure: (jd ad) = oe.

literal translation: i am thing that imagine something.

}◀

}◀structure of sentence

▶'oa doea od'{

oa o!1p=this A.

'1p' mean 1th parameter. type of this word is type of parameter.

doea !t=time.

't' mean 'time' so type of this word is time.

od !t=now.//c this, time,

'c' is an abbreviation for 'compound word'.

'c A, B' mean 'this word consist of word A and word B'.

if there are '//c' then the word is compound word or abbreviation.

'od' is abbreviation for 'oa doea'. 'oa doea' mean 'this time'.

in this case, 'c' used to mean 'abbreviation'.

4bit is from 'oa'(0111,0000).

4bit is from 'doea'(1100,011100100000).

structure: (oa doea) = od.

literal translation: now is this time.

▶'jd cf fojb bd oe'{

just saying 'jd cf fojb bd' is enough.

jd o!r=thing that imagine A.

cf s!r=situation that A2 is A1.

the 's' is an abbreviation for 'sentence'. 's' is like 'o,o' so 'A1' mean first 'o'. 'A2' mean second 'o'.

fojb !r=alive thing.

bd !r=you.//a i,

oe !r=i.//c this,assert,

structure: (jd (cf fojb bd)) = oe.

literal translation: i am thing that imagine situation that you are alive thing.

free translation: i imagine that you are alive.

}◀

▶'mc bc oe'{

mc s,n!r=thing that hope A2 is A1.//e B is degree of hope.

'n' mean 'number'. this word have number type parameter too but other type is in number type parameter so it is automatically omitted.

bc !si=symbol that omit two parameter.

structure: (mc bc) = oe.

literal translation: i am thing that hope.

free translation: i hope.


}◀

▶'higina  af elga oe'{

af o,o!1p=A of B.//c A that is B, element,

this function need two parameter. and parameter type is object and object.

B is second input object of this function.

third is C. fourth is D...

eg 'af A B' mean 'A of B'.

reason why 'af' is 'c A that is B, element' is that 'ab A hc B' mean 'A that is (element of B)'.

ab o,o!1p=A that is B.

hc o!1p=element of A.

'c A that is B, element,' seems 'ah' since first letter of 'ab' and 'hc' is 'a' and 'h'.

only number word must be in between 'ag' and 'ph'.(eg 'ag', 'bg', 'cg'....'ph')

'ah' is in it so 'ah'(00001110) become 'af'(00001010).

elga !r=name.

oe !r=i.//c this,assert,

structure: higina = (af elga oe).

literal translation: name of me is higina.

free translation: 'my name is higina'.

▶how to use word 'ea' basic{

In this language, the word for 'what'(as in 'what I love') is 'ea'.

if i love you, then you are what i love. we can know word for 'what' return direct object.

'mkfd bd oe' mean 'i love you'.

'ea mkfd oe bd' mean you are what i love. 'ea mkfd oe' mean 'what i love'.

happily, word 'ea' can express more thing.

let's see definition of word 'mkfd'.

mkfd o,n!r=thing that love A.//e B is degree of love,

yes, second parameter is degree of love so if we make word 'ea' return second parameter, then we can express degree of love(how much do i love you).

'ea nh' return second parameter cuz 'nh' mean 2.

'ea nh mkfd bd oe' mean 'how much do i love you'.

'he mkfd bd oe' mean same cuz word 'he' is 'ea nh'. this word is for efficient.

'ea mkfd bd pa oe' mean same. word 'pa' is in place for expressing degree of love.

We will learn how to apply this.

we have new word for efficient.

'ae anga mkfd oe' mean 'ab anga ea mkfd oe'. if you wanna make it return other parameter, then the number must attach to word 'ae'.

eg 'ae nh anga ed mkfd oe' mean 'ab anga ea nh ed mkfd oe'.

if you think that this expression is inefficient, then we can use word 'ne'. word 'ne' mean 'ae nh' so 'ne anga ed mkfd oe' mean 'ae nh anga ed mkfd oe'.

well... how to express 'my hope'.

sentence 'i hope i am human' mean 'i hope situation that i am human is true'.

so you can express 'my hope' as 'he mc ff oe'.

mc s,n!r=thing that hope A2 is A1.//e B is degree of hope.

'ff' mean 'true'.

you can use word 'pc' to explain it.

word 'pc' make word 'ea' return sentence.

word 'lh' is in parameter of word 'db'. and word 'lh' mean 'one'. so the 'db lh' return first subject. and it is subject 'bd'. this is why word 'dd' is abbreviation for word 'db' and word 'lh'. word 'dd' return first subject. if parameter of word 'db' is omitted, then it return second subject.

'oilb ab dd A B' mean 'thing that need (oneself that is A) for being B'.

This expreasion is a bit awkward so i will explain with an example.

sentence 'oilb ab dd A B C' mean 'C need C that is A to be B'. 

The floor of 16 divided by 3 is 5 but this compound word is not made by 5bits cuz the length of element word in the compound word must be a power of 2.

so 'oidd' is 4bit + 4bit + 8bit.

it is 0111 + 0000 + 11001100.

8th bit become 1.

8bit + 4bit + 4bit is prohibited cuz the earlier-used word should be made with fewer bits but if quantity of bit of element word is 8 or more, then all bit dont need to be reduced.

▶'djfb koea bg pb oe'{

djfb t!r=A old.//c remain,exist,

bg int!n=.//e this word is for expressing number by binary.

'int' is an abbreviation for 'integer'.

first bit determines whether the number is positive or negative.

if first bit is zero, number is negative.

'pb' is in parameter of word 'bg'.

integer 'pb' is '11111000'.

(2nd bit)*1=1. (3rd bit)*2=2. (4th bit)*4=4. (5th bit)*8=8. (6th bit)*16=0. (7th bit)*32=0.

1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15. so 'bgpb' is 15.

if u wanna express negative then reverse all bit.

▶'gjfg o,n!r=thing that save A.//c cause, alive'{

antonym of save is kill.

we learned int type parameter.

if bits of word alive and dead is converted into number, it is 'fojb(1010011110011000) < kjgg(0101100101100110)'.

word alive is smaller than word dead if it is converted into number.

compound word that have antonym is made by word that have smaller bit.

word 'kill' can be 'c cause,dead' but alive have smaller bit than dead so word 'kill' is made as antonym.

▶'jf s,n!r=result of A2 being A1.//a reason,'{

gc s,n!r=reason why A2 is A2.

'gc' is '0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0'.

'jf' is '1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0'.

word reason is randomly made.

The reason happens before the result, so the word "reason" was created earlier than the word "result." so word reason must have smaller bit than word result.

* antonym should have bigger bit than original word that is randomly made.

▶'hnmc !r=music.//c sound,pleasure,'{

'sound that i feel pleasure from' is expressed as 'ae hnih mkcd oe'.

but if this word is made by 4 words then people cant know element word.

important word in it is 'hnih'(sound) and 'mkcd'(pleasure).

it is made by the two words.

it is abbreviation.

earlier used word must be earlier so this compound word must be compund word of 'sound' + 'pleasure' instead of 'pleasure' + 'sound'.

}◀

▶'dnfd o,n!r=thing that hate A.//c dread, profit,'{

why this word is not made by antonym.

if it is made by antonym then it is dnke so form and sound of it is similar to dfke and meaning of dfke similar to love cuz it mean thing that dread that something become victim.

this language has no synonyms so just think and use words as appropriate.

eg this language dont have word large so you should use word big instead of word large.

symbol '-' is old version's symbol so convert it into ','.

ignore symbol '<', '>'.

word is listed using two diffrent rule.

left rule is listing using '//n' cuz if it is listed by the rule then hard to find.

the rule is listing by initial letter and word formation rule














▶logic{

▶word 'hb'{

For the sentence “A is B” to be true, what A must be?

If A is “B that is C,” then the statement “A is B” is true.
For example, if you are a human that is man, then you are a human is true.

However, if A is B that is C, only 'A is B' can be true; 'B is A' cannot be true.
but there are sentence that is true despite position is reversed.
If A is element of B, then 'A is element of B' is true. 'element of B is A' is also true.

Why does this phenomenon occur? what is value of A?
This value cannot be expressed in English.
In this language, that value is expressed by the word “hb".

hb c o!1p=.

if A is 'hb B C ad' then 'A is B' and 'A is C' and 'A is B and C' and 'B is A' and 'C is A' and 'B and C is A' is true.

if A have pen and pig. animal that is element of A is only pig cuz pig is animal.

if A have B and C, then element of A is expressed as 'hb B C ad'. 

we can know how to say 'what do you like? A or B?' in this language.

it is 'fc ae hb A B ad mkid bd'.

▶ECL{

you can understand well if you know EML and ECL words.

sentence 'A B' command B to be A.

We’ll learn some rules that help me explain it more efficiently.

A ◇ B ◇ C. A is ECL code. B is programming language name. C is code that is wrriten by A.

eg, ja •1 •2 ◇ js ◇ •2 == •1. •1 is first variable. •2 is second variable. in real, you should input variable name instead of •1.

'A ♤ B' mean 'B is explanation of A'.

▶example{

•1 •2 ♤ make variable called •2. assign •1 into •2.

mg •1 •2 •3 ♤ •3 is •1 + •2.

coda •1 ♧ •1 is printed. if right of expression is none then it command to system.
