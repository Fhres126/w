This artificial language is called epluial(Efficient Perfect Logical Unambigious International Auxiliary Language) in English.

▶persuasion{

summary: this language is easy and most efficient and logical and unambigious binary language that can express all meaning so it can easily be converted into morse code and QR code and barcode and braille and sign language so it help all communiciation. this language have lot of advantages so it can become International Auxiliary Language. this language reduces environmental pollution.

most words are not randomly made.

lot of words is compound words.

eg word 'hnmc' mean music.(this language use phonetic script but this language is pronounced differently from english and it is easy to pronounce.) word 'hnmc' is compound word of sound and fun.

word 'bomc' mean sports. it is compound word of compete and fun.

lot of words is abbreviations.

eg word 'od' is abbreviation for 'Oa Doea'(this time).

lot of words are arranged in an orderly way.

eg bihd mean hydrogen(Atomic number 1). cihd mean helium(Atomic number 2). dihd mean lithium(Atomic number 3). eihd mean beryllium(Atomic number 4).

so it help technology grow cuz it make science easy.

Words used in similar situations or words with similar meanings are made of similar letters

eg mkfd mean love. mkid mean like. mkcd mean pleasure so you can easily guess the meaning of abbreviation you see for the first time.

lot of words is antonyms.

'ed'(0010.1100) mean 'was'.

'le'(1101.0010) mean 'will' and it is antonym of word 'was'.

the bits is reversed.(8n-th bit that is zero is for expressing border of word)

length of most words are short.(2~4letters) so you can easily remember words.

grammar is simplest and very logical and consistent so this language can be used in programming.

eg javascript code 'var gh=1==2;
console.log(gh);' is expressed as 'ja lh nh gh
dida gh'. grammar didnt be changed.

the programming language is called 'pmfa'.

Other programming languages have limits. For example, C++ cannot represent numbers beyond a certain size, but pmfa can represent all number.

if you learn a little grammar, then you can explain every meaning, regardless of your native language.

this language dont have slang.

this language dont have all ambigous.

english eaaly becomes ambiguous. eg 'i love situation that i love person who love cow and people and chicken or he eat meal'. but this language express all situation without ambigious.

in english, "A of B and C" can be interpreted as "(A of B) and C" and "A of (B and C)".

but in this language, "be af A B C" means only "(A of B) and C".

'af A be B C' means only 'A of (B and C)'.(it is like profix notation. profix notation have lot of advanrage. eg it dont need all parentheses)

word think have three meaning it is imagine and beilive and ponder so word for think is not exist in this language.

unambigous is very good for language cuz it make efficient cuz it doesn't need any additional explanation or images to explain exactly.

this language doesn't have exceptions.

this language version of barcodes is exist and it is called NL QR1.

NL QR1 is most efficient 1D code.

it is usually four times more efficient than barcode.

barcode use 145cell to mention 'i am person' but NL QR1 use 28cell.</pre>
  <img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/vsbar.png" alt="connect error">
  <pre>
    this language version of QR code is exist and it is called NL QR2.

NL QR2 is most efficient 2D code.

NL QR2 is usually over 4 times more efficient than a QR code.

eg QR code use 441cell to mention 'i am person' but NL QR2 use 32cell.
  </pre>
  <img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/vsqr.png" alt="connect error">
  <pre>
    NL QR mean NL QR1, NL QR2, NL QR3.

meaning of all NL QR is Not affected by direction, like a QR code.
  </pre>
  <img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/principlenlqr.jpg" alt="connect error">
  <pre>
    NL QR3 is most efficient code.
  </pre>
  <img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/nlqrs.jpg" alt="connect error">
  <pre>
    NL QR can help cheating in exam because it is human-readble. it takes up little space and most people won't think of it as a language, so it won't get caught.

imagine what if NL QR replace pictogram. we dont need to learn lot of pictogram.
  </pre>
  <img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/hatepictogram.jpg" alt="connect error">
  <pre>
    this language version of morse code is exist and it is called NL morse.

NL Morse is usually two times more efficient than Morse code.

morse code cant explain mathmatical expression but NL morse can express all meaning.

this language version of braille is exist and it is called NL braille.

NL braille is usually 1.5 times more efficient than braille.

original Braille is ambigious cuz meaning of original braille depending on direction but NL braille can have same meaning in any direction.

Sign language is difficult or inefficient for expressing new words or slang but this language's sign language is not.

this language is a binary language so it can easily be converted into NL QR and NL morse and NL braille and sign language and minecraft language and etc and you can learn it easily so you can do many things by learning this language so person who learn this language can easily communicate with the blind and the deaf.

this language is usually three times more efficient than English.

eg 'i know you' in this language is 'lbbd'.

English is 80 bits (in ASCII code).

this language is 16 bits cuz one letter is 4 bits.

one letter is 8bit in ascii code but this language can express all meaning using binary.

letter is used for expressing binary and this language can express all meaning using only binary so it is 4bit.

The prevention of environmental pollution through this language is enormous scale.

most data in world is video data but if someone speak in this language, the someone dont need to speak for long time so video become short.

A sentence that takes 10 seconds to say in English can be said in just 5 seconds in this language.

this language is very consistent so polution by AI and LLM will be reduced.

this language dont have homonyms and synonyms.

keyboard that is for this language is easy to type cuz it has only 2~16letter.
  </pre>
  <img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/easykeyboard.png" alt="connect error">
  <pre>
    this language can be unambiguous interpreted without whitespace so it deosnt need hassle mark eg whitespace and hyphen.
  </pre>
  <img src="https://fhres126.github.io/w/hatehasslemark.png" alt="connect error">
  <pre>
    this language can and must be International Auxiliary Language cuz it is needed to reduce environaltal pollution and make easy communicafion between disabled people and non-disabled people and support efficient communiciation. supporting other IAL is a terror.

this language brings easy communication and peace and helps technology grow.

person that dislike this language are just those who haven’t properly read this document.

as a developer, i belive that this language is perfect so dont dislike this language before you are fluent in it.

▶alphabet{

* this language use only 0 and 1. it can be expressed as 16 latin letter.

a = 0000. b = 1000. c = 0100. d = 1100.

e = 0010. f = 1010. g = 0110. h = 1110.

i = 0001. j = 1001. k = 0101. l = 1101.

m = 0011. n = 1011. o = 0111. p = 1111.

this language uses only lowercase letters.

braille is 2×3 and this alphabet is 2×3 so this alphabet can be used as braille.

▶word separation, spacing{

one word consist of 8n bit.

8n-th bit determines length of word since it is for explaining length of word.

* 8n-th bit that is zero mean that area of this word is finished.

it play role of whitespace of english so this language dont need whitespace.

eg '11111110' is one word.

it is 'ph' in latin letter.

it means that word that have 2n-th letter that is in between lettter 'a'(0000) and 'h'(1110) is consist of smaller bit. 

2n-th letter 'h' is in between 'a'(0000) and 'h'(1110).

* 8n-th bit 1 make the word consist of more bit.

'11111111, 11111110' is one word.

the example converted to latin letter is 'ppph'.

this language dont need whitespace but i will use whitespace to make you easily understand.

quiz: How many words does this sentense have?

'mkfdbdoe'.

(1) 1.
(2) 2.
(3) 3.

answer: 3.

}word separation, spacing◀

▶pronunciation{

* Two letters make one syllable.

* (2n-1)th letter is pronounced as initial consonant. 

* 2n-th letter is pronounced as vowel and final consonant.

eg 'bb anba' is pronounced as [ bo membu ].

if 'b' is in (2n-1)-th letter then it pronounced as 'b'.

if 'b' is in 2n-th letter then it pronounced as 'o'.

in pronunciation chart, 'b' is 'b' and 'o'.

then 'anba' is pronounced as 'membu' then it can be simplified as 'meb'.

this language can express all pronunciation using parameter.

▶pronunciation chart{

sound consists of decibels (dB) and hertz (Hz).

the pronunciation is arranged with lower Hz sounds coming first.(eg m(100hz) < s(14000hz))

so it is not biased toward any specific culture.

a = 'm', 'oo'. b = 'b', 'o'. c = 'd', eo'. d = 'g', 'eu'.

e = 'n', 'a'. f = 'l', 'e'. g = 'f', 'i'. h = 'tt', 'wo'.

i = 'kk', 'oom'. j = 'p', 'om'. k = 't', 'eom'. l = 'k', 'eum'.

m = 'j', 'am'. n = 'jj', 'em'. o = 'ch', im'. p = 's', 'wae'.

m as in mom. b as in bee. d as in doctor. g as in goal.

n as in no. l as in ling. p as in polar.


eu in bro.(silent vowel)

▶IPA version{

a = /m/, /u/. b = /b/, /o/, . c = /d/, /ʌ/. d = /g/, /ɯ/.

e = /n/, /a/. f = /ɾ/, /ɛ/. g = /p͈/, /i/. h = /t͈/, /wʌ/.

i = /k͈/, /um/. j = /p/, /om/. k = /t/, /ʌm/. l = /k/, /ɯm/.

m = /tɕ/, /am/. n = /t͈ɕ/, /ɛm/. o = /t͡ʃ/, /im/. p: /s/, /wɛ/.

}IPA version◀

}pronunciation chart◀

▶read it if you dislike this pronunciation{

initial consonant that is easy to distinguish is 19.

vowel that is easy to distinguish is 10.

silent sound and h aren't used cuz it make problem.

The pronunciation [ma] is made by quickly saying [m] and [a].

The pronunciation [ta] is made by quickly saying [d] and [ha].

I think adding silent sounds and h would make the language inconsistent and unlogical.

i allow that user freely pronunce so It doesn't matter whether you pronounce the 'r' in a Spanish, German, or British accent pronunciation.

if word is long then there are final consonant 'm'.

This mechanism makes long word difficult to say so user dont wanna made long word so it becomes efficient.

▶EML(Efficient Memory Language){

▶lecture{

* word order of this language similar to VOS cuz it is efficient for logical grammar.

* this language use function instead of transitive verb.

* all direct object is called parameter.

so direct object must attach to transitive verb.

* this language sentence is list of two objects.

* in this language sentence 'A B', if A and B is noun. it mean 'B is A'. 

this language is VOS and english is SVO so subject and object must change each other's location.

'fojb' mean 'alive thing' and it is noun. 'oe' mean 'i' and it is noun. so 'fojb oe' mean 'i am alive'.

* some word must have parameter like function.

function 'jd' must have one parameter.

in 'jd A', 'jd' is function. 'A' is parameter that is in function 'jd'.

'jd A' mean 'thing that Imagine A'.

'bd' mean 'you' so 'jd bd' mean 'thing that Imagine you'.

'oe' mean 'i' and 'me' so 'jd bd oe' mean 'i am thing that imagine you'.

'jd bd   oe' mean 'i imagine you' in paraphrase.

FYR: (jd bd) = oe.

between '(' and ')' is one function.

'jd bd' is one object since function is object.

* if subject is omitted, subject is 'i' so meaning of sentence 'jd bd' is meaning of sentence 'jd bd oe'.

we use word 'i' lot so this mechanism increace efficiency of language.

but i wont omit subject to make you easily understand.

this grammar can express every meaning.

eg 'The happy boy gives her a small book in the today and smiles.' is expressed as 'mb oihg cd gb if ab elellkkg nimd lmle ad ab nide mkcd'.

explaing logical language using unlogical language is difficult so sometime i will use this language to explain this language so you should well understand so i need to use part of word dictionary to explain it so you need to know some how to interpret a word dictionary.

▶How to interpret a word dictionary{

▶'fojb !r=alive thing.'{

word is expressed as it in word dictionary.

* far left is this language word.

* between '!' and '=' is word type.

* far right is meaning of this word.

* 'r' is an abbreviation for 'reality'.

it is type of only word that is not number or etc.

}◀

▶'jd o!r=thing that imagine A.'{

between this language word and '!' is parameter type that this function must have.

if it is exist, this word should have parameter.

'o' is an abbreviation for 'object' so any parameter can inputed in this word.

'A' in right of '=' is first inputed object of function.

'jd A' mean 'thing that Imagine A'.

'bd' mean 'you' so 'jd bd' mean 'thing that Imagine you'.

change A into inputed value.

Q: this word should have parameter so how to express just 'word imagine' or 'word for imagine'?

A: it is 'elfa jd', word in parameter of 'elfa' deosnt have parameter.

}◀

▶'kjgg !r=dead thing.//a alive,'{

'//' is for an additional explanation.

'a' is an abbreviation for 'antonym'.

* 'a A' mean 'this word is antonym of A'.

* The antonym form is the inversion of the original word's bits.

0 becomes 1. 1 becomes 0.

eg antonym of 
'fojb'(10100111,10011000) is 
'kjgg'(01011001,01100110).

8n-th bit dont be changed since it is for explaining length of word.

(1) i imagine.
(2) imagine me!
(3) i imagine me.
(4) imagine of me.

parameter of 'jd' is omitted by 'ad'.

if parameter is omitted, it means 'something'.

answer: (1)

free translation: 'i imagine'.

structure: (jd ad) = oe.

literal translation: i am thing that imagine something.

▶'od !t=now.//c this, time,'{

'c' is an abbreviation for 'compound word'.

'c A, B' mean 'this word consist of word A and word B'.

'c A,B' can mean 'this word is compound word of A and B'.

but "c A, B" can mean 'this word is abbreviation for A B'.

'od' is abbreviation for 'oa doea'.

'oa doea' mean 'this time'.

in this case, 'c' used to mean 'abbreviation'.

4bit is from 'oa'(0111,0000).

4bit is from 'doea'(1100,011100100000).

▶'jd cf fojb bd oe'{

just saying 'jd cf fojb bd' is enough.

jd o!r=thing that imagine A.

cf s!r=situation that A2 is A1.

the 's' is an abbreviation for 'sentence'. 's' is 'o,o'.

so 'A1' mean first 'o'. 'A2' mean second 'o'.

fojb !r=alive thing.

bd !r=you.//a i,

▶'higina  af elga oe'{

free translation: 'my name is higina'.

structure: higina = (af elga oe).

literal translation: name of me is higina.

af o,o!1p=A of B.//c A that is B, element,

this function need two parameter. and parameter type is object and object.

B is second input object of this function.

third is C. fourth is D...

eg 'af A B' mean 'A of B'.

reason why 'af' is 'c A that is B, element' is that 'ab A hc B' mean 'A that is (element of B)'.

ab o,o!1p=A that is B.

hc o!1p=element of A.

'c A that is B, element,' seems 'ah' since first letter of 'ab' and 'hc' is 'a' and 'h'.

only number word must be in between 'ag' and 'ph'.(eg 'ag', 'bg', 'cg'....'ph')

'ah' is in it so 'ah'(00001110) become 'af'(00001010).

▶how to use word 'ea' basic{

In this language, the word for 'what'(as in 'what I love') is 'ea'.

if i love you, then you are what i love.

we can know word for 'what' return direct object.

'mkfd bd oe' mean 'i love you'.

'ea mkfd oe bd' mean you are what i love.

'ea mkfd oe' mean 'what i love'.

happily, word 'ea' can express more thing.

let's see definition of word 'mkfd'.

mkfd o,n!r=thing that love A.//e B is degree of love,

yes, second parameter is degree of love so if we make word 'ea' return second parameter, then we can express 'how much do i love you'.

'ea nh' return second parameter cuz 'nh' mean 2.

'ea nh mkfd bd oe' mean 'how much do i love you'.

'he mkfd bd oe' mean same cuz word 'he' is 'ea nh'. this word is for efficient.

'ea mkfd bd pa oe' mean same. word 'pa' is in place for expressing degree of love.

eg 'ae nh anga ed mkfd oe' mean 'ab anga ea nh ed mkfd oe'.

if you think that this expression is inefficient, then we can use word 'ne'. word 'ne' mean 'ae nh' so ''ne anga ed mkfd oe' mean 'ae nh anga ed mkfd oe'.

well... how to express 'my hope'.

sentence 'i hope i am human' mean 'i hope situation that i am human is true'.

so you can express 'my hope' as 'he mc ff oe'.

This expreasion is a bit awkward so i will explain with an example.

sentence 'oilb ab dd A B C' mean 'C need C that is A to be B'. 

The floor of 16 divided by 3 is 5 but this compound word is not made by 5bits cuz the length of element word in the compound word must be a power of 2.

so 'oidd' is 4bit + 4bit + 8bit.

it is 0111 + 0000 + 11001100.

8th bit become 1.

8bit + 4bit + 4bit is prohibited cuz the earlier-used word should be made with fewer bits but if quantity of bit of element word is 8 or more, then all bit dont need to be reduced.
