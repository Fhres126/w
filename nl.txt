▶norlang{

This artificial language is called Norlang (Normal Language) in English.

▶Advertisement{

summary: norlang is easy and most efficient and logical and unambigious binary language that can express all meaning so it can easily be converted into morse code and QR code and barcode and braille and sign language. norlang reduces environmental pollution.

most words are not randomly made.

lot of words is compound words.

eg word 'hnmc' mean music.(norlang use phonetic script but norlang is pronounced differently from english and it is easy to pronounce.)

word 'hnmc' is compound word of sound and pleasure.

lot of words is abbreviations.

eg word 'od' is abbreviation for Oa(this) and Doea(time).

lot of words is antonyms.

'ed'(0010.1100) mean 'was'.

'le'(1101.0010) mean 'will' and it is antonym of word 'was'.

the bit is reversed.(8n-th bit didnt reversed since it is  whitespace)

lot of words are arranged in an orderly way.

eg 'eoea' mean second, 'foea' mean minute, 'goea' mean hour....

Word that have similar meanings consist of similar letters.

eg mkfd mean love. mkid mean like. mkcd mean pleasure so you can easily guess the meaning of abbreviation you see for the first time.

length of most words are short.(2~4letters) so you can easily remember words.

grammar is simplest and very logical and consistent so norlang can be used in programming.

eg javascript code 'var gh=1==2;
console.log(gh);' is expressed as 'ja lh nh gh
elba gh'.

if you learn a little grammar, then you can explain every meaning, regardless of your native language.

norlang dont have slang.

norlang dont have all ambigous.

eg in english, "A of B and C" can be interpreted as "(A of B) and C" and "A of (B and C)".

but in norlang, "be af A B C" means only "(A of B) and C".

'af A be B C' means only 'A of (B and C)'.(it is like profix notation)

unambigous is very good for language cuz it make efficient cuz it doesn't need any additional explanation or images when explaining exactly.

Norlang doesn't have exceptions.

norlang version of barcodes is exist and it is called NL QR1.

NL QR1 is most efficient 1D code.

it is usually two times more efficient a barcode.

norlang version of QR code is exist and it is called NL QR2.

NL QR2 is most efficient 2D code.

NL QR2 is usually over 4 times more efficient than a QR code.


NL QR mean NL QR1, NL QR2, NL QR3.

NL QR is interpreted as same in any direction, like a QR code.

NL QR3 is most efficient code.

norlang version of morse code is exist and it is called NL morse.

NL Morse is usually two times more efficient than Morse code.

morse code cant explain mathmatical expression but norlang can express it.

norlang version of braille is exist and it is called NL braille.

NL braille is usually 1.5 times more efficient than braille.

original Braille is ambigious cuz meaning of original braille depending on direction but NL braille can have same meaning in any direction.

norlang is a binary language so it can easily be converted into NL QR and NL morse and NL braille and sign language and minecraft language and etc so you can do many things by learning this language.

norlang is usually three times more efficient than English.

eg 'i know you' in Norlang is 'lbbd'.

English is 80 bits (in ASCII code).

Norlang is 16 bits cuz one letter is 4 bits.

one letter is 8bit in ascii code but norlang can express all meaning using binary.

letter is used for expressing binary and norlang use only binary so it is 4bit.

The prevention of environmental pollution through norlang is enormous scale.

most data in world is video data but if someone speak in norlang, the someone dont need to speak for long time so video become short.

A sentence that takes 10 seconds to say in English can be said in just 5 seconds in Norlang.

norlang is very consistent so polution by AI and LLM will be reduced.

norlang dont have homonyms and synonyms.

keyboard that is for norlang is easy to type cuz it has only 2~16letter.


this language can be unambiguous interpreted without whitespace so it deosnt need hassle mark eg whitespace and hyphen.


norlang can be International Auxiliary Language using this lot of advantages.

norlang brings easy communication and peace and helps technology grow.

as a developer, i belive that this language is perfect so dont dislike this language before you are fluent in it.

this language is beta version.

▶alphabet{

* alphabet is only 0 and 1 then it can be expressed as 16 latin letter.

a:0000. b:1000. c:0100. d:1100.

e:0010. f:1010. g:0110. h:1110.

i:0001. j:1001. k:0101. l:1101.

m:0011. n:1011. o:0111. p:1111.

norlang uses only lowercase letters.

more efficient alphabet is here(only pdf user can see. bottom to top writting alphabet):

braille is 2×3 and this alphabet is 2×3 so this alphabet can be used as braille.

one word consist of 8n bit.

8n-th bit determines length of word since it is for explaining length of word.

* 8n-th bit that is zero mean that area of this word is finished.

it play role of whitespace of english so norlang dont need whitespace.

eg '11111110' is one word.

it is 'ph' in latin letter.

it means that word that have 2n-th letter that is in between lettter 'a'(0000) and 'h'(1110) is consist of smaller bit. 

2n-th letter 'h' is in between 'a'(0000) and 'h'(1110).

* 8n-th bit 1 make the word consist of more bit.

'11111111, 11111110' is one word.

the example converted to latin letter is 'ppph'.

norlang dont need whitespace but i will use whitespace to make you easily understand.

you can learn pronunciation in intermediate section and i recommend that you read this document in order.

▶EML(Efficient Memory Language){

▶lecture{

▶basic{

* word order of norlang similar to VOS cuz it is efficient for logical grammar.

* norlang use function instead of transitive verb.

* all direct object is called parameter.

so direct object must attach to transitive verb.

* norlang sentence is list of two objects.

* in norlang sentence 'A B', if A and B is noun. it mean 'B is A'. 

norlang is VOS and english is SVO so subject and object must change each other's location.

eg 'foba   foad' mean 'ore is solid'.

'foba' mean 'solid' and it is noun.

'foad' mean 'ore' and it is noun.

* some word must have parameter like function.

function 'jd' must have one parameter.

in 'jd A', 'jd' is function. 'A' is parameter that is in function 'jd'.

'jd A' mean 'thing that Imagine A'.

'bd' mean 'you' so 'jd bd' mean 'thing that Imagine you'.

'oe' mean 'i' and 'me' so 'jd bd oe' mean 'i am thing that imagine you'.

'jd bd   oe' mean 'i imagine you' in paraphrase.

FYR: (jd bd) oe.(between '(' and ')' is one function.)

'jd bd' is one object since function is object.

* if subject is omitted, subject is 'i' so meaning of sentence 'jd bd' is meaning of sentence 'jd bd oe'.

we use word 'i' lot so this mechanism increace efficiency of language.

but i wont omit subject to make you easily understand.

this grammar can express every meaning.

eg 'The happy boy gives her a small book in the today and smiles.' is expressed as 'mb oihg cd gb if ab elellkkg fjmd lmle ad ab fjde mkcd'.

explaing logical language using unlogical language is difficult so sometime i will use norlang to explain norlang so you should well understand so i need to use part of word dictionary to explain it so you need to know how to interpret a word dictionary.

▶How to interpret a word dictionary{

'fojb !r=alive thing.'{

word is expressed as it in word dictionary.

* far left is norlang word.

* between '!' and '=' is word type.

* far right is meaning of this word.

* 'r' is an abbreviation for 'reality'.

it is type of only word that is not number or etc.

}

'kjgg !r=dead thing.//a alive'{

'//' is for an additional explanation.

'a' is an abbreviation for 'antonym'.

* 'a A' mean 'this word is antonym of A'.

* The antonym form is the inversion of the original word's bits.

0 becomes 1. 1 becomes 0.

eg antonym of 
'fojb'(10100111,10011000) is 
'kjgg'(01011001,01100110).

8n-th bit dont be changed since it is for explaining length of word.

}

'jd o!r=thing that Imagine A.'{

between norlang word and '!' is parameter type that this function must have.

if it is exist, this word should have parameter.

'o' is an abbreviation for 'object'.

any object can be in object type parameter.

'A' in right of '=' is first inputed object of function.

'jd A' mean 'thing that Imagine A'.

'bd' mean 'you' so 'jd bd' mean 'thing that Imagine you'.

change A into inputed value.

Q: oh this word should have parameter so how to express just 'word image'?.

A: 'elea jd', word in parameter of 'elea' deosnt have parameter. this parameter type is called 'int parameter'. If you read further, you can learn it.

I can only answer your question after you know some concept.

}

'da !si=line break'{

'si' is abbreviation for 'sign'.

this word is used to express only line break(aka new line).

'si' type words don't interface with all words.

eg sentence 'jd da bd oe' means 'jd bd oe' because the word doesn't interface with 'si' type words.

}

}How to interpret a word dictionary

'jd ad oe'{

free translation: 'i imagine'.

FYR: (jd ad) oe.

translation whose only words are translated: '(something that imagine something) is me'.

literal translation: i am thing that imagine something.

jd o!r=thing that Imagine A.

ad !si=symbol that omit one parameter.

oe !r=i.//c this,assert,,r this who assert.

parameter of 'jd' is omitted by 'ad'.

if parameter is omitted, it means 'something'.

Q: what is 'r' in right of '//' mean?

A: ignore what you didnt learn. we will learn it.

}basic

▶intermediate{

▶How to interpret a word dictionary{

'fc o,o!r=thing that ask B about A.//c command,reply,'{

'!A,B' mean this function need 'A' and 'B' as parameter.

B is second input object of this function.

third is C. fourth is D...

eg 'fc A B' mean 'thing that ask B about A'.

parameter type that this function must have is object and object.

}

'ih !n=zero'{

'n' is abbreviation for 'number'.

'ag' ~ 'ph' is number word.

}

'od !t=now.//c this, time,'{

'c' is an abbreviation for 'compound word'.

'c A, B' mean 'this word consist of word A and word B'.

'c A,B' can mean 'this word is compound word of A and B'.

but "c A, B" can mean 'this word is abbreviation for A B'.

'od' is abbreviation for 'oa doea'.

'oa doea' mean 'this time'.

in this case, 'c' used to mean 'abbreviation'.

4bit is from 'oa'(0111,0000).

4bit is from 'doea'(1100,011100100000).

}

mkfd o,n!r=thing that love A with B percent power.//c hope,profit,,e The love between a family and a child,,{

',,' finished 'c'.

this symbol is used when word need more explaination.

some english word have lot of meaning so some word have explanation of meaning in additional explanation.

'e' in '//e' is abbreviation for 'explanation'.

'//e A' mean that explaination of this word is A.

}

'oa o!1p=this A'{

'p' is abbreviation for 'parameter'.

'1p' mean 'first parameter'.

parameter value determines type of this word.

eg 'oa fojb' is reality type cuz fojb is reality type object.

}

'gc s-n!p=reason why A2 is A1'{

's' is an abbreviation for 'sentence'.

's' is '<o,o>'.

so 'A1' mean first 'o'.

'A2' mean second 'o'.

}

'be c o!p=A1 and A2 and....'{

'c A' mean 'this word have A type parameter until it met symbol that omit parameter'.

eg 'be bd bd bd ad' mean 'you and you and you'.

}

eoea n!t=Asecond.{

't' is abbreviation for 'time'.

}

'mkid o,n!r=thing that like A.//s love B'{

's A B' mean 'letter of this word is similar to word A of language B'.

if B is omitted, B is norlang.

}

'ma o!1p=all A.//m every'{

'm A' mean that this word can mean A too.

}

}How to interpret a word dictionary

'mkfd bd oe'{

free translation: 'i love you'.

FYR: (mkfd bd) oe.

translation whose only words are translated: '(something that love you) is me'.

literal translation: 'i am something that love you'.

mkfd o,n!r=thing that love A with B percent power.//c hope,profit,,The love between a family and a child,,

bd !r=you.//a i,

oe !r=i.

as we can see, word 'mkfd' have number type parameter.

'mkfd bd ih' mean 'thing that love you with zero percent power'.

this expression might be awkward.

'thing that love you with zero percent power' mean 'thing that dont love you'.

ih !n=zero.

in this sentence, 'oe' automatically omit second parameter 'n' of 'mkfd' cuz number type didnt be inputed in the number parameter.

i will explain reason why 'love' is 'c hope, profit'.

Love has various meanings.

There is the love between parents and children, and romantic love.

This word refers to the love between a parent and a child.

mc s,n!r=thing that hope that A2 is A1 by B percent power.

fd n!r=thing that gains profit.

'mc fd A' mean 'thing that hope that A is thing that gains profit'.

FYR: (mc fd A).

parent tend to hope child gain profit since most organism is selfish.

}

'higina  af elda oe'{

free translation: 'my name is higina'.

FYR: higina (af elda oe).

translation whose only words are translated: 'higina is name of me'.

literal translation: name of me is higina.

af o,o!1p=A of B.//c A that is B, element,

elda !v=name.

oe !r=i.

reason why 'af' is 'c A that is B, element' is that 'ab A hc B' mean 'A that is (element of B)'.

ab o-o!1p=A that is B.

hc o!1p=element of A.

'c A that is B, element,' seems 'ah' since first letter of 'ab' and 'hc' is 'a' and 'h'.

i will detaily explain it in advanced section but i explain reason simply in here.

only number word must be in 'ag' and 'ph'.(eg 'ag', 'bg', 'cg'....'ph')

'ah' is in it so 'ah'(00001110) become 'af'(00001010).

You might feel that some words is weird until reading this document since you dont know word-formation rule but the word-formation rules will be explained in the advanced section in detail so please wait.

'b' is 'bo' in pronunciation chart.

if 'b' is in (2n-1)-th letter then it pronounced as 'b'.

if 'b' is in 2n-th letter then it pronounced as 'o'.

(2n-1)th letter 'f' is pronounced as 'r'.

2n-th letter 'h' is pronounced as 'wo'.

initial consonant that is easy to distinguish is  20.

if word is long then there are final consonant 'm'.

This mechanism makes long word difficult to say so user dont wanna made long word so it becomes efficient.

eg 'cb lh anga' mean 'one people'.

If different type word like 'r' is in place of an 'n' type parameter, then 'n' is automatically omitted.

if parameter 'n' of 'cb' is omitted, it is one.

eg 'cb anga' mean 'one person' or 'a person'.

green ore is green that is ore.

if you think that it is efficient, then you can make compound word.

the result is 'mipifoad', 

}

'eye doctor' dont mean 'eye that is doctor'.

'eye doctor' mean 'doctor that promise to fix eye'.

it is 'ab doee doba gjfg hlca'.

the result is 'doemhlca'.

'doemhlca' is compound word of 'doctor' and 'eye'

and compound word of 'eye' and 'doctor' is prohibited cuz in compound word functuon must be in after if order is not matter(eg 'A that is B' is 'B that is A' so it is order is not matter)

▶how to express -ing{

Language exists to express reality, so we should convert what "-ing" means in reality into reality.

The English suffix “-ing” is an inconsistent expression.

In the sentence “I am going home,” “-ing” represents a change.

this sentence mean 'i moving to coordinate 1, then to 2, and then to 3'.

it can be expressed as “thing that becoming thing that went home”.

However, 'i am standing' is not change.

 “I am wearing clothes,” “-ing” is not change.

"i am wearing clothes" dont mean “I am thing that becoming thing that wear clothes.”

'i wear clothes' mean 'i become thing is weaing clothes'.

if you thought language that is converted into reality, then you will agree.

mp- is ing eg mpjokb is killing.

▶how to use word 'ea'{

word 'ea' is similar to 'what' as in 'what i love'.

lets assume i love you.

'i love you' is 'mkfd bd oe'.

'what i love is you' is 'bd ea lh mkfd oe' or 'bd ea mkfd pa oe' or 'bd ea mkfd oe'.

as for first expression 'bd ea lh mkfd oe'.

'lh' mean one so word 'ea' return first parameter of 'mkfd'.

this number must attach to word 'ea' and be in next of word 'ea'.

as for second expression 'bd ea mkfd pa oe'.

word 'pa' is in first parameter of 'mkfd' so word 'ea' return first parameter of 'mkfd'.

as for third expression 'bd ea mkfd oe'.

there are no number and word 'pa' so word 'ea' return first parameter of 'mkfd' automatically.

word 'mkfd' have two parameter.

'mkfd bd lh oe' mean 'i love you 100percent'.

'bd' and 'lh' is in parameter of 'mkfd'.

if word 'ea' target second parameter then it is 'How much I love you'.

'ea nh mkfd bd oe' mean 'How much I love you'.

if you think that this expression is inefficient then you can use word 'he'.

word 'he' is 'ea nh'.

'he mkfd bd oe' mean 'ea nh mkfd bd oe'.

as for how to express person that i love.

"ab anga ea mkfd oe' mean 'person that is what i love' and 'person that i love' or 'lovely person'.

it is little inefficient so we can use word 'ae'.

'ae anga mkfd oe' mean 'ab anga ea mkfd oe'.

'people that i loved' is 'ae nh anga ed mkfd oe'.

the number must attach to word 'ae' and be in next of word 'ae'.

this expression seems inefficient so we can use word 'ne'.

word 'ne' mean 'ae nh' so ''ne anga ed mkfd oe' mean 'ae nh anga ed mkfd oe'.

'fg dec!n=decimal number'{

'dec' is abbreviation for 'decimal number'.

this word is for expressing decimal number.

4bit express one number.

'fg ja' mean 9.

'j' in dec is 1.

'a' finish parameter dec.

'b' is 1.

'c' is 2.

'd' is 3.

'e' is 4.

'f' is 5.

'g' is 6.

'h' is 7.

'i' is 8.

'j' is 9.

'k' is 0 since if 'a' is '0' it cant be visible in NL QR.

'fgbcda' is 321.

'b' is 1. 'c' is 2. 'd' is 3.

so it seems 123 but this language use little andian so it is reversed.

}

ah dec,dec!n=decimal rational number.{

first 'dec' ia fractional part.

norlang emphasizes efficiency.

expressing fractional part firstly is efficient when expressing 0.5 because it does not need to express integers. 

}

'bg int!n=integer'{

'int' is an abbreviation for 'integer'.

'int' is for expressing only integer.

so code in int dont make parameter.

'bg' express integer number.

eg 'bg he' is 35.

first bit determines whether the number is positive or negative.

if first bit is zero, number is negative.

integer 'he' is '111000010'.

(2nd bit)*1=1.

(3rd bit)*2=2.

(4th bit)*4=0.

(5th bit)*8=0.

(6th bit)*16=0.

(7th bit)*32=32.

1+2+32=35.

so it is 35.

}

'//b A'{

'b' is abbreviarion for 'before'.

'b A' mean that this word is before word of A.

}

'foea n!t=A minute.//n second,'{

'n' is abbreviation for 'next'

'n A' mean that this word is next word of A.

word 'eoea' mean second.

next letter of 'e' is 'f' so next word of 'eoea'(second) is 'foea'(minute) so 'foea' mean 'minute'.

}

'//p A B'{

'p' is an abbreviation for 'pronunciation'.

'p A B' means that the pronunciation of this word is derived from the word A of language B.

language name of ISO code alpha2 is in B.

if it is omitted, it is norlang.

}

'//r'{

'r' is abbreviation for 'reason'.

'r' is used to explain why this word is made this way.

}

}how to interpret a word dictionary

▶word formation rule{

'gjfg o,n!r=thing that save A.//c cause, alive'{

antonym of save is kill.

we learned int type parameter.

if bits of word alive and dead is converted into number, it is 'fojb(1010011110011000) < kjgg(0101100101100110)'.

word alive is smaller than word dead.

compound word that have antonym is made by small bit word.

word 'kill' can be 'c cause,dead' but alive have smaller bit than dead so word 'kill' is made as antonym.

}

'jf s,n!r=result of A2 being A1.//a reason,'{

gc s,n!r=reason why A2 is A2.

'gc' is '0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0'.

'jf' is '1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0'.

word reason is randomly made.

The reason happens before the result, so the word "reason" was created earlier than the word "result." so word reason that converted to numbers must less than word result that converted to number.

* antonym should have bigger bit than original word that is randomly made.

}

'oidd o,o,n=thing that need to be A to be B,//c need,A that is B,self,.'{

oilb o,o,n!r=thing that need A to be B.

ab o,o!r=A that is B.

dd !r=self.//c Ath subject,one,

reason why word 'oidd' is 'c need,A that is B,self,' is 'oilb ab dd A B' mean 'thing that need (oneself that is A) for being B'.

This expreasion is a bit awkward so i will explain with an example.

sentence 'oilb ab dd A B C' mean 'C need C that is A to be B'. 

The floor of 16 divided by 3 is 5 but this compound word is not made by 5bits cuz the length of element word in the compound word must be a power of 2.

so 'oidd' is 0111 + 0000 + 11001100.

8th bit become 1.

as i mentioned, 'c' can mean abbreviation.

'i dislike being people' can be translated into 'dnfd ab dd anga oe'.

}

'hnmc !r=music.//c sound,pleasure,'{

'sound that i feel pleasure from' is expressed as 'ae hnih mkcd oe'.

but if this word is made by 4 words then people cant know element word.

important word in it is 'hnih'(sound) and 'mkcd'(pleasure).

it is made by the two words.

it is abbreviation.

new word should make element of new word remain order of original expression so this compound word must compund word of 'sound' + 'pleasure' instead of 'pleasure' + 'sound'.

bit of antonym is inverse of original word so 0 become 1, 1 become 0.

thing that is made first(eg seller exist to make buyer,, women is made before men exist)

original(eg 'df' mean 'meeb' so 'me' is first).

many quantity(eg photon is mannier than neutrino).

}antonym that should be made first

if spectific word have lot of antonym, order of antonym that should be made first is 'firsrt exist(no slave,no king)->low number(0% can=cant)->purpose(weapon,treatment tool,,intend,evolution)->diffrence set(dont know,know)'.

antonym of specific compound word dont following rule 'word that should come first' so many quantity word can have big bit.

antonym form should not same as antonym converted into compound word(eg word 'forgot' that made by antonym mechnism)

}antonym

▶compound word{

'girlfriend' = 'c women, love' cuz original expression is 'ae mlmb mkfd'. it should keep original expression.

value is first than function.

compound word consist of word that is more basic first.

if new compound word overlap with other compound word,first element word of new compound word become small.(eg '00,10' become '0,1'. but if length of area of element is 1, use XOR).

length of bit of element of compound word must power of two.

if quantity of element word is less than 4, then element of compound word such as symbol that omit parameter, ea, of, and, or, also is in start or end, it is omitted.

less bit word of compound word is first in situation whose order doesn't matter but we should avoid the situation first.

compound word consist of less word first so we shouldnt use antonym as element of compoun word firstly.

if length of element compound word of compound word is less than whole bit divided by 8,and new word is should expressed as antonym of this word, use antonym mechanism.

In compound words, those made up of fewer visible elements become split first.

function word is before.

first action word is made first, if it is advantageous(eg remember is firster than forgot).

If a word can be expressed as an antonym and also as a compound word.

if word created by the antonym mechanism has the same meaning as the original word(eg mkfd=dnfd) then use compound word mechanism.

If the original word too similar to compound wkrd, use antonym mechanism(eg i(com expres,this,o) -> you(com sense, this, o))

If the bits of a word expressed as a compound word differ by less than 1/4 from its antonym, use the antonym mechanism..

and If a compound word consists of two words, use the compound word mechanism first using their antonym.(eg mkfd->dnfd)

If not, use the antonym mechanism first.

▶history{

I like science so i readed too many science document.

but in scientific documents that is written by natural language, there are many bad expression.

they use the word 'big' and 'cold' without expressing standard and they use word and grammar in weird way.

There are also many ambiguous expressions.

the writer use word in wrong way.

I intended to think about reason why there are many bad expression.

the reason is that people use inferior language.

if you use word big with standard, then the expression become very inefficient so many people dont explain standard.

I've learned that language can be much simpler by reading scientific documents frequently.

and i bellived that inferior language very harmful mankind so I decided to make new language.

ill say history but i dont know detial date.

▶prediction{

in 6month 2022year i thinked that new language is needed.

in 9month 2022 i used my own temporary symbol for expressing science.

in 10month 2022 i thought that verb must be in first since verb is important for grammar.

i decided to make new language in 1month 2023year.

in 1m 2023 i decided to make VSO language since it make we dont need to distinguish transitive verb in sometime.

VSO and logical grammar is very ineficient so i decide to make binary language in 2023y5m.

i decided to use binary language that similar to morse code 7m d 2023y.(video that use morse code to express norlang from 2023y 7m 16d is confirmed)

i gave up use morse code for my conlang in 2023y 11m 20d.

i thought about VSO sentence 'ask i people' then i thought that if my conlang use VOS, then it is efficient since it dont need to mention subject. but how to make Rationale?' so i made function-noun grammar system. VOS is finalization in 3m 2024.

NL QR is made in 2024y 3m.(video that use NL QR2 and VOSfrom 2024y 3m 15d 18h 2mi is confirmed)

in 2024y 4~7m i gave up making conlnag since i think that my purpose is imposible since i intended to make language that is same in every civilization including outerspace i thought how elilian made language and absolute language in mathmatical and logical way since i belived that only one binary langage must be exist.

i decided to retry make language since my conalng is too helpful for enviroment in 2024y 7m.

in 9, 12 month 2024y 1, 2m 2025 i remade all words when wrting system or word formation rule is changed i did it 4times until i make norlang. there are many words but i remade so i was painful.

in 12day 10month 2024year i published my conlang and i got criticized.

antonym mechanism is finalization in 3m 2025.

2025y 4m, conpound word rule is confirmed.
